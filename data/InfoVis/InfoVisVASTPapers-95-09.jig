        <docText>ABySS-Explorer: Visualizing Genome Sequence
        Assemblies

One bottleneck in large-scale genome sequencing projects is
reconstructing the full genome sequence from the short subsequences
produced by current technologies. The final stages of the genome
assembly process inevitably require manual inspection of data
inconsistencies and could be greatly aided by visualization. This paper
presents our design decisions in translating key data features
identified through discussions with analysts into a concise visual
encoding. Current visualization tools in this domain focus on local
sequence errors making high-level inspection of the assembly difficult
if not impossible. We present a novel interactive graph display,
ABySS-Explorer, that emphasizes the global assembly structure while also
integrating salient data features such as sequence length. Our tool
replaces manual and in some cases pen-and-paper based analysis tasks,
and we discuss how user feedback was incorporated into iterative design
refinements. Finally, we touch on applications of this representation
not initially considered in our design phase, suggesting the generality
of this encoding for DNA sequence data.</docText>

        <docText>Constructing Overview + Detail
        Dendrogram-Matrix Views

A dendrogram that visualizes a clustering hierarchy is often
integrated with a re-orderable matrix for pattern identification. The
method is widely used in many research fields including biology,
geography, statistics, and data mining. However, most dendrograms do not
scale up well, particularly with respect to problems of graphical and
cognitive information overload. This research proposes a strategy that
links an overview dendrogram and a detail-view dendrogram, each
integrated with a re-orderable matrix. The overview displays only a
user-controlled, limited number of nodes that represent the
ldquoskeletonrdquo of a hierarchy. The detail view displays the sub-tree
represented by a selected meta-node in the overview. The research
presented here focuses on constructing a concise overview dendrogram and
its coordination with a detail view. The proposed method has the
following benefits: dramatic alleviation of information overload,
enhanced scalability and data abstraction quality on the dendrogram, and
the support of data exploration at arbitrary levels of detail. The
contribution of the paper includes a new metric to measure the
ldquoimportancerdquo of nodes in a dendrogram; the method to construct
the concise overview dendrogram from the dynamically-identified,
important nodes; and measure for evaluating the data abstraction quality
for dendrograms. We evaluate and compare the proposed method to some
related existing methods, and demonstrating how the proposed method can
help users find interesting patterns through a case study on
county-level U.S. cervical cancer mortality and demographic data.</docText>

        <docText>MizBee: A Multiscale Synteny Browser

In the field of comparative genomics, scientists seek to
answer questions about evolution and genomic function by comparing the
genomes of species to find regions of shared sequences. Conserve
dsyntenic blocks are an important biological data abstraction for
indicating regions of shared sequences. The goal of this work is to show
multiple types of relationships at multiple scales in a way that is
visually comprehensible in accordance with known perceptual principles.
We present a task analysis for this domain where the fundamental
questions asked by biologists can be understood by a characterization of
relationships into the four types of proximity/location, size,
orientation, and similarity/strength, and the four scales of genome,
chromosome, block, and genomic feature. We also propose a new taxonomy
of the design space for visually encoding conservation data. We present
MizBee, a multiscale synteny browser with the unique property of
providing interactive side-by-side views of the data across the range of
scales supporting exploration of all of these relationship types. We
conclude with case studies from two biologists who used MizBee to
augment their previous automatic analysis work flow, providing anecdotal
evidence about the efficacy of the system for the visualization of
syntenic data, the analysis of conservation relationships, and the
communication of scientific insights.</docText>

        <docText>GeneShelf: A Web-based Visual Interface for Large Gene Expression
Time-Series Data Repositories

A widespread use of high-throughput gene expression analysis
techniques enabled the biomedical research community to share a huge
body of gene expression datasets in many public databases on the web.
However, current gene expression data repositories provide static
representations of the data and support limited interactions. This
hinders biologists from effectively exploring shared gene expression
datasets. Responding to the growing need for better interfaces to
improve the utility of the public datasets, we have designed and
developed a new web-based visual interface entitled GeneShelf
(http://bioinformatics.cnmcresearch.org/GeneShelf). It builds upon a
zoomable grid display to represent two categorical dimensions. It also
incorporates an augmented timeline with expandable time points that
better shows multiple data values for the focused time point by
embedding bar charts. We applied GeneShelf to one of the largest
microarray datasets generated to study the progression and recovery
process of injuries at the spinal cord of mice and rats. We present a
case study and a preliminary qualitative user study with biologists to
show the utility and usability of GeneShelf.</docText>

        <docText>Spatiotemporal Analysis of Sensor Logs
        using Growth Ring Maps

Spatiotemporal analysis of sensor logs is a challenging
research field due to three facts: a) traditional two-dimensional maps
do not support multiple events to occur at the same spatial location, b)
three-dimensional solutions introduce ambiguity and are hard to
navigate, and c) map distortions to solve the overlap problem are
unfamiliar to most users. This paper introduces a novel approach to
represent spatial data changing over time by plotting a number of
non-overlapping pixels, close to the sensor positions in a map. Thereby,
we encode the amount of time that a subject spent at a particular sensor
to the number of plotted pixels. Color is used in a twofold manner;
while distinct colors distinguish between sensor nodes in different
regions, the colors' intensity is used as an indicator to the temporal
property of the subjects' activity. The resulting visualization
technique, called growth ring maps, enables users to find similarities
and extract patterns of interest in spatiotemporal data by using humans'
perceptual abilities. We demonstrate the newly introduced technique on a
dataset that shows the behavior of healthy and Alzheimer transgenic,
male and female mice. We motivate the new technique by showing that the
temporal analysis based on hierarchical clustering and the spatial
analysis based on transition matrices only reveal limited results.
Results and findings are cross-validated using multidimensional scaling.
While the focus of this paper is to apply our visualization for
monitoring animal behavior, the technique is also applicable for
analyzing data, such as packet tracing, geographic monitoring of sales
development, or mobile phone capacity planning.</docText>

        <docText>A Nested Process Model for Visualization
        Design and Validation

We present a nested model for the visualization design and
validation with four layers: characterize the task and data in the
vocabulary of the problem domain, abstract into operations and data
types, design visual encoding and interaction techniques, and create
algorithms to execute techniques efficiently. The output from a level
above is input to the level below, bringing attention to the design
challenge that an upstream error inevitably cascades to all downstream
levels. This model provides prescriptive guidance for determining
appropriate evaluation approaches by identifying threats to validity
unique to each level. We also provide three recommendations motivated by
this model: authors should distinguish between these levels when
claiming contributions at more than one of them, authors should
explicitly state upstream assumptions at levels above the focus of a
paper, and visualization venues should accept more papers on domain
characterization.</docText>

        <docText>Conjunctive Visual Forms

Visual exploration of multidimensional data is a process of
isolating and extracting relationships within and between dimensions.
Coordinated multiple view approaches are particularly effective for
visual exploration because they support precise expression of
heterogeneous multidimensional queries using simple interactions. Recent
visual analytics research has made significant progress in identifying
and understanding patterns of composed views and coordinations that
support fast, flexible, and open-ended data exploration. What is missing
is formalization of the space of expressible queries in terms of visual
representation and interaction. This paper introduces the conjunctive
visual form model in which visual exploration consists of
interactively-driven sequences of transitions between visual states that
correspond to conjunctive normal forms in boolean logic. The model
predicts several new and useful ways to extend the space of rapidly
expressible queries through addition of simple interactive capabilities
to existing compositional patterns. Two recent related visual tools
offer a subset of these capabilities, providing a basis for conjecturing
about such extensions.</docText>

        <docText>Interaction Techniques for Selecting and Manipulating Subgraphs
in Network Visualizations

We present a novel and extensible set of interaction
techniques for manipulating visualizations of networks by selecting
subgraphs and then applying various commands to modify their layout or
graphical properties. Our techniques integrate traditional rectangle and
lasso selection, and also support selecting a node's neighbourhood by
dragging out its radius (in edges) using a novel kind of radial menu.
Commands for translation, rotation, scaling, or modifying graphical
properties (such as opacity) and layout patterns can be performed by
using a hotbox (a transiently popped-up, semi-transparent set of
widgets) that has been extended in novel ways to integrate specification
of commands with 1D or 2D arguments. Our techniques require only one
mouse button and one keyboard key, and are designed for fast, gestural,
in-place interaction. We present the design and integration of these
interaction techniques, and illustrate their use in interactive graph
visualization. Our techniques are implemented in NAViGaTOR, a software
package for visualizing and analyzing biological networks. An initial
usability study is also reported.</docText>

        <docText>ActiviTree: Interactive Visual Exploration of Sequences in
Event-Based Data Using Graph Similarity

The identification of significant sequences in large and
complex event-based temporal data is a challenging problem with
applications in many areas of today's information intensive society.
Pure visual representations can be used for the analysis, but are
constrained to small data sets. Algorithmic search mechanisms used for
larger data sets become expensive as the data size increases and
typically focus on frequency of occurrence to reduce the computational
complexity, often overlooking important infrequent sequences and
outliers. In this paper we introduce an interactive visual data mining
approach based on an adaptation of techniques developed for Web
searching, combined with an intuitive visual interface, to facilitate
user-centred exploration of the data and identification of sequences
significant to that user. The search algorithm used in the exploration
executes in negligible time, even for large data, and so no
pre-processing of the selected data is required, making this a
completely interactive experience for the user. Our particular
application area is social science diary data but the technique is
applicable across many other disciplines.</docText>

        <docText>?Search, Show Context, Expand on Demand?: Supporting Large Graph
Exploration with Degree-of-Interest

A common goal in graph visualization research is the design of
novel techniques for displaying an overview of an entire graph. However,
there are many situations where such an overview is not relevant or
practical for users, as analyzing the global structure may not be
related to the main task of the users that have semi-specific
information needs. Furthermore, users accessing large graph databases
through an online connection or users running on less powerful (mobile)
hardware simply do not have the resources needed to compute these
overviews. In this paper, we advocate an interaction model that allows
users to remotely browse the immediate context graph around a specific
node of interest. We show how Furnas' original degree of interest
function can be adapted from trees to graphs and how we can use this
metric to extract useful contextual subgraphs, control the complexity of
the generated visualization and direct users to interesting datapoints
in the context. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach with an
exploration of a dense online database containing over 3 million legal
citations.</docText>

        <docText>A Comparison of User-Generated and
        Automatic Graph Layouts

The research presented in this paper compares user-generated
and automatic graph layouts. Following the methods suggested by van Ham
et al. (2008), a group of users generated graph layouts using both
multi-touch interaction on a tabletop display and mouse interaction on a
desktop computer. Users were asked to optimize their layout for
aesthetics and analytical tasks with a social network. We discuss
characteristics of the user-generated layouts and interaction methods
employed by users in this process. We then report on a web-based study
to compare these layouts with the output of popular automatic layout
algorithms. Our results demonstrate that the best of the user-generated
layouts performed as well as or better than the physics-based layout.
Orthogonal and circular automatic layouts were found to be considerably
less effective than either the physics-based layout or the best of the
user-generated layouts. We highlight several attributes of the various
layouts that led to high accuracy and improved task completion time, as
well as aspects in which traditional automatic layout methods were
unsuccessful for our tasks.</docText>

        <docText>Smooth Graphs for Visual Exploration of Higher-Order State
Transitions

In this paper, we present a new visual way of exploring state
sequences in large observational time-series. A key advantage of our
method is that it can directly visualize higher-order state transitions.
A standard first order state transition is a sequence of two states that
are linked by a transition. A higher-order state transition is a
sequence of three or more states where the sequence of participating
states are linked together by consecutive first order state transitions.
Our method extends the current state-graph exploration methods by
employing a two dimensional graph, in which higher-order state
transitions are visualized as curved lines. All transitions are bundled
into thick splines, so that the thickness of an edge represents the
frequency of instances. The bundling between two states takes into
account the state transitions before and after the transition. This is
done in such a way that it forms a continuous representation in which
any subsequence of the timeseries is represented by a continuous smooth
line. The edge bundles in these graphs can be explored interactively
through our incremental selection algorithm. We demonstrate our method
with an application in exploring labeled time-series data from a
biological survey, where a clustering has assigned a single label to the
data at each time-point. In these sequences, a large number of cyclic
patterns occur, which in turn are linked to specific activities. We
demonstrate how our method helps to find these cycles, and how the
interactive selection process helps to find and investigate activities.</docText>

        <docText>Configuring Hierarchical Layouts to Address
        Research Questions

We explore the effects of selecting alternative layouts in
hierarchical displays that show multiple aspects of large multivariate
datasets, including spatial and temporal characteristics. Hierarchical
displays of this type condition a dataset by multiple discrete variable
values, creating nested graphical summaries of the resulting subsets in
which size, shape and colour can be used to show subset properties.
These 'small multiples' are ordered by the conditioning variable values
and are laid out hierarchically using dimensional stacking. Crucially,
we consider the use of different layouts at different hierarchical
levels, so that the coordinates of the plane can be used more
effectively to draw attention to trends and anomalies in the data. We
argue that these layouts should be informed by the type of conditioning
variable and by the research question being explored. We focus on
space-filling rectangular layouts that provide data-dense and rich
overviews of data to address research questions posed in our exploratory
analysis of spatial and temporal aspects of property sales in London. We
develop a notation ('HiVE') that describes visualisation and layout
states and provides reconfiguration operators, demonstrate its use for
reconfiguring layouts to pursue research questions and provide
guidelines for this process. We demonstrate how layouts can be related
through animated transitions to reduce the cognitive load associated
with their reconfiguration whilst supporting the exploratory process.</docText>

        <docText>Visualizing Social Photos on a Hasse Diagram for Eliciting
Relations and Indexing New Photos

Social photos, which are taken during family events or
parties, represent individuals or groups of people. We show in this
paper how a Hasse diagram is an efficient visualization strategy for
eliciting different groups and navigating through them. However, we do
not limit this strategy to these traditional uses. Instead we show how
it can also be used for assisting in indexing new photos. Indexing
consists of identifying the event and people in photos. It is an
integral phase that takes place before searching and sharing. In our
method we use existing indexed photos to index new photos. This is
performed through a manual drag and drop procedure followed by a content
fusion process that we call 'propagation'. At the core of this process
is the necessity to organize and visualize the photos that will be used
for indexing in a manner that is easily recognizable and accessible by
the user. In this respect we make use of an object Galois sub-hierarchy
and display it using a Hasse diagram. The need for an incremental
display that maintains the user's mental map also leads us to propose a
novel way of building the Hasse diagram. To validate the approach, we
present some tests conducted with a sample of users that confirm the
interest of this organization, visualization and indexation approach.
Finally, we conclude by considering scalability, the possibility to
extract social networks and automatically create personalised albums.</docText>

        <docText>Interactive Dimensionality Reduction Through User-defined
Combinations of Quality Metrics

Multivariate data sets including hundreds of variables are
increasingly common in many application areas. Most multivariate
visualization techniques are unable to display such data effectively,
and a common approach is to employ dimensionality reduction prior to
visualization. Most existing dimensionality reduction systems focus on
preserving one or a few significant structures in data. For many
analysis tasks, however, several types of structures can be of high
significance and the importance of a certain structure compared to the
importance of another is often task-dependent. This paper introduces a
system for dimensionality reduction by combining user-defined quality
metrics using weight functions to preserve as many important structures
as possible. The system aims at effective visualization and exploration
of structures within large multivariate data sets and provides
enhancement of diverse structures by supplying a range of automatic
variable orderings. Furthermore it enables a quality-guided reduction of
variables through an interactive display facilitating investigation of
trade-offs between loss of structure and the number of variables to
keep. The generality and interactivity of the system is demonstrated
through a case scenario.</docText>

        <docText>Scattering Points in Parallel Coordinates

In this paper, we present a novel parallel coordinates design
integrated with points (scattering points in parallel coordinates,
SPPC), by taking advantage of both parallel coordinates and
scatterplots. Different from most multiple views visualization
frameworks involving parallel coordinates where each visualization type
occupies an individual window, we convert two selected neighboring
coordinate axes into a scatterplot directly. Multidimensional scaling is
adopted to allow converting multiple axes into a single subplot. The
transition between two visual types is designed in a seamless way. In
our work, a series of interaction tools has been developed. Uniform
brushing functionality is implemented to allow the user to perform data
selection on both points and parallel coordinate polylines without
explicitly switching tools. A GPU accelerated dimensional incremental
multidimensional scaling (DIMDS) has been developed to significantly
improve the system performance. Our case study shows that our scheme is
more efficient than traditional multi-view methods in performing visual
analysis tasks.</docText>

        <docText>Bubble Sets: Revealing Set Relations with Isocontours over
Existing Visualizations

While many data sets contain multiple relationships, depicting
more than one data relationship within a single visualization is
challenging. We introduce Bubble Sets as a visualization technique for
data that has both a primary data relation with a semantically
significant spatial organization and a significant set membership
relation in which members of the same set are not necessarily adjacent
in the primary layout. In order to maintain the spatial rights of the
primary data relation, we avoid layout adjustment techniques that
improve set cluster continuity and density. Instead, we use a
continuous, possibly concave, isocontour to delineate set membership,
without disrupting the primary layout. Optimizations minimize cluster
overlap and provide for calculation of the isocontours at interactive
speeds. Case studies show how this technique can be used to indicate
multiple sets on a variety of common visualizations.</docText>

        <docText>FromDaDy: Spreading Aircraft Trajectories Across Views to Support
Iterative Queries

When displaying thousands of aircraft trajectories on a
screen, the visualization is spoiled by a tangle of trails. The visual
analysis is therefore difficult, especially if a specific class of
trajectories in an erroneous dataset has to be studied. We designed
FromDaDy, a trajectory visualization tool that tackles the difficulties
of exploring the visualization of multiple trails. This multidimensional
data exploration is based on scatterplots, brushing, pick and drop,
juxtaposed views and rapid visual design. Users can organize the
workspace composed of multiple juxtaposed views. They can define the
visual configuration of the views by connecting data dimensions from the
dataset to Bertin's visual variables. They can then brush trajectories,
and with a pick and drop operation they can spread the brushed
information across views. They can then repeat these interactions, until
they extract a set of relevant data, thus formulating complex queries.
Through two real-world scenarios, we show how FromDaDy supports
iterative queries and the extraction of trajectories in a dataset that
contains up to 5 million data.</docText>

        <docText>SellTrend: Inter-Attribute Visual Analysis of Temporal
Transaction Data

We present a case study of our experience designing SellTrend,
a visualization system for analyzing airline travel purchase requests.
The relevant transaction data can be characterized as multi-variate
temporal and categorical event sequences, and the chief problem
addressed is how to help company analysts identify complex combinations
of transaction attributes that contribute to failed purchase requests.
SellTrend combines a diverse set of techniques ranging from time series
visualization to faceted browsing and historical trend analysis in order
to help analysts make sense of the data. We believe that the combination
of views and interaction capabilities in SellTrend provides an
innovative approach to this problem and to other similar types of
multivariate, temporally driven transaction data analysis. Initial
feedback from company analysts confirms the utility and benefits of the
system.</docText>

        <docText>Comparing Dot and Landscape Spatializations for Visual Memory
Differences

Spatialization displays use a geographic metaphor to arrange
non-spatial data. For example, spatializations are commonly applied to
document collections so that document themes appear as geographic
features such as hills. Many common spatialization interfaces use a 3-D
landscape metaphor to present data. However, it is not clear whether 3-D
spatializations afford improved speed and accuracy for user tasks
compared to similar 2-D spatializations. We describe a user study
comparing users' ability to remember dot displays, 2-D landscapes, and
3-D landscapes for two different data densities (500 vs. 1000 points).
Participants' visual memory was statistically more accurate when viewing
dot displays and 3-D landscapes compared to 2-D landscapes. Furthermore,
accuracy remembering a spatialization was significantly better overall
for denser spatializations. Theseresults are of benefit to visualization
designers who are contemplating the best ways to present data using
spatialization techniques.</docText>

        <docText>Flow Mapping and Multivariate Visualization of Large Spatial
Interaction Data

Spatial interactions (or flows), such as population migration
and disease spread, naturally form a weighted location-to-location
network (graph). Such geographically embedded networks (graphs) are
usually very large. For example, the county-to-county migration data in
the U.S. has thousands of counties and about a million migration paths.
Moreover, many variables are associated with each flow, such as the
number of migrants for different age groups, income levels, and
occupations. It is a challenging task to visualize such data and
discover network structures, multivariate relations, and their
geographic patterns simultaneously. This paper addresses these
challenges by developing an integrated interactive visualization
framework that consists three coupled components: (1) a spatially
constrained graph partitioning method that can construct a hierarchy of
geographical regions (communities), where there are more flows or
connections within regions than across regions; (2) a multivariate
clustering and visualization method to detect and present multivariate
patterns in the aggregated region-to-region flows; and (3) a highly
interactive flow mapping component to map both flow and multivariate
patterns in the geographic space, at different hierarchical levels. The
proposed approach can process relatively large data sets and effectively
discover and visualize major flow structures and multivariate relations
at the same time. User interactions are supported to facilitate the
understanding of both an overview and detailed patterns.</docText>

        <docText>Temporal Summaries: Supporting Temporal Categorical Searching,
Aggregation and Comparison

When analyzing thousands of event histories, analysts often
want to see the events as an aggregate to detect insights and generate
new hypotheses about the data. An analysis tool must emphasize both the
prevalence and the temporal ordering of these events. Additionally, the
analysis tool must also support flexible comparisons to allow analysts
to gather visual evidence. In a previous work, we introduced align,
rank, and filter (ARF) to accentuate temporal ordering. In this paper,
we present temporal summaries, an interactive visualization technique
that highlights the prevalence of event occurrences. Temporal summaries
dynamically aggregate events in multiple granularities (year, month,
week, day, hour, etc.) for the purpose of spotting trends over time and
comparing several groups of records. They provide affordances for
analysts to perform temporal range filters. We demonstrate the
applicability of this approach in two extensive case studies with
analysts who applied temporal summaries to search, filter, and look for
patterns in electronic health records and academic records.</docText>

        Interfaces

Hierarchical representations are common in digital
repositories, yet are not always fully leveraged in their online search
interfaces. This work describes ResultMaps, which use hierarchical
treemap representations with query string-driven digital library search
engines. We describe two lab experiments, which find that ResultsMap
users yield significantly better results over a control condition on
some subjective measures, and we find evidence that ResultMaps have
ancillary benefits via increased understanding of some aspects of
repository content. The ResultMap system and experiments contribute an

        <docText>Lark: Coordinating Co-located Collaboration with Information
Visualization

Large multi-touch displays are expanding the possibilities of
multiple-coordinated views by allowing multiple people to interact with
data in concert or independently. We present Lark, a system that
facilitates the coordination of interactions with information
visualizations on shared digital workspaces. We focus on supporting this
coordination according to four main criteria: scoped interaction,
temporal flexibility, spatial flexibility, and changing collaboration
styles. These are achieved by integrating a representation of the
information visualization pipeline into the shared workspace, thus
explicitly indicating coordination points on data, representation,
presentation, and view levels. This integrated meta-visualization
supports both the awareness of how views are linked and the freedom to
work in concert or independently. Lark incorporates these four main
criteria into a coherent visualization collaboration interaction
environment by providing direct visual and algorithmic support for the
coordination of data analysis actions over shared large displays.</docText>

        <docText>The Benefits of Synchronous Collaborative Information
Visualization: Evidence from an Experimental Evaluation

A great corpus of studies reports empirical evidence of how
information visualization supports comprehension and analysis of data.
The benefits of visualization for synchronous group knowledge work,
however, have not been addressed extensively. Anecdotal evidence and use
cases illustrate the benefits of synchronous collaborative information
visualization, but very few empirical studies have rigorously examined
the impact of visualization on group knowledge work. We have
consequently designed and conducted an experiment in which we have
analyzed the impact of visualization on knowledge sharing in situated
work groups. Our experimental study consists of evaluating the
performance of 131 subjects (all experienced managers) in groups of 5
(for a total of 26 groups), working together on a real-life knowledge
sharing task. We compare (1) the control condition (no visualization
provided), with two visualization supports: (2) optimal and (3)
suboptimal visualization (based on a previous survey). The facilitator
of each group was asked to populate the provided interactive visual
template with insights from the group, and to organize the contributions
according to the group consensus. We have evaluated the results through
both objective and subjective measures. Our statistical analysis clearly
shows that interactive visualization has a statistically significant,
objective and positive impact on the outcomes of knowledge sharing, but
that the subjects seem not to be aware of this. In particular, groups
supported by visualization achieved higher productivity, higher quality
of outcome and greater knowledge gains. No statistically significant
results could be found between an optimal and a suboptimal visualization
though (as classified by the pre-experiment survey). Subjects also did
not seem to be aware of the benefits that the visualizations provided as
no difference between the visualization and the control conditions was
found for the self-reported measures of satisfaction a- nd
participation. An implication of our study for information visualization
applications is to extend them by using real-time group annotation
functionalities that aid in the group sense making process of the
represented data.</docText>

        <docText>Harnessing the Information Ecosystem with Wiki-based
Visualization Dashboards

We describe the design and deployment of Dashiki, a public
Website where users may collaboratively build visualization dashboards
through a combination of a wiki-like syntax and interactive editors. Our
goals are to extend existing research on social data analysis into
presentation and organization of data from multiple sources, explore new
metaphors for these activities, and participate more fully in the Web's
information ecology by providing tighter integration with real-time
data. To support these goals, our design includes novel and low-barrier
mechanisms for editing and layout of dashboard pages and visualizations,
connection to data sources, and coordinating interaction between
visualizations. In addition to describing these technologies, we provide
a preliminary report on the public launch of a prototype based on this
design, including a description of the activities of our users derived
from observation and interviews.</docText>

        <docText>SpicyNodes: Radial Layout Authoring for the
        General Public

Trees and graphs are relevant to many online tasks such as
visualizing social networks, product catalogs, educational portals,
digital libraries, the semantic web, concept maps and personalized
information management. SpicyNodes is an information-visualization
technology that builds upon existing research on radial tree layouts and
graph structures. Users can browse a tree, clicking from node to node,
as well as successively viewing a node, immediately related nodes and
the path back to the ldquohomerdquo nodes. SpicyNodes' layout algorithms
maintain balanced layouts using a hybrid mixture of a geometric layout
(a succession of spanning radial trees) and force-directed layouts to
minimize overlapping nodes, plus several other improvements over prior
art. It provides XML-based API and GUI authoring tools. The goal of the
SpicyNodes project is to implement familiar principles of radial maps
and focus+context with an attractive and inviting look and feel in an
open system that is accessible to virtually any Internet user.</docText>

        <docText>code_swarm: A Design Study in Organic
        Software Visualization

In May of 2008, we published online a series of software
visualization videos using a method called code_swarm. Shortly
thereafter, we made the code open source and its popularity took off.
This paper is a study of our code swarm application, comprising its
design, results and public response. We share our design methodology,
including why we chose the organic information visualization technique,
how we designed for both developers and a casual audience, and what
lessons we learned from our experiment. We validate the results produced
by code_swarm through a qualitative analysis and by gathering online
user comments. Furthermore, we successfully released the code as open
source, and the software community used it to visualize their own
projects and shared their results as well. In the end, we believe
code_swarm has positive implications for the future of organic
information design and open source information visualization practice.</docText>

        <docText>Towards Utilizing GPUs in Information Visualization: A Model and
Implementation of Image-Space Operations

Modern programmable GPUs represent a vast potential in terms
of performance and visual flexibility for information visualization
research, but surprisingly few applications even begin to utilize this
potential. In this paper, we conjecture that this may be due to the
mismatch between the high-level abstract data types commonly visualized
in our field, and the low-level floating-point model supported by
current GPU shader languages. To help remedy this situation, we present
a refinement of the traditional information visualization pipeline that
is amenable to implementation using GPU shaders. The refinement consists
of a final image-space step in the pipeline where the multivariate data
of the visualization is sampled in the resolution of the current view.
To concretize the theoretical aspects of this work, we also present a
visual programming environment for constructing visualization shaders
using a simple drag-and-drop interface. Finally, we give some examples
of the use of shaders for well-known visualization techniques.</docText>

        <docText>A Multi-Threading Architecture to Support Interactive Visual
Exploration

During continuous user interaction, it is hard to provide rich
visual feedback at interactive rates for datasets containing millions of
entries. The contribution of this paper is a generic architecture that
ensures responsiveness of the application even when dealing with large
data and that is applicable to most types of information visualizations.
Our architecture builds on the separation of the main application thread
and the visualization thread, which can be cancelled early due to user
interaction. In combination with a layer mechanism, our architecture
facilitates generating previews incrementally to provide rich visual
feedback quickly. To help avoiding common pitfalls of multi-threading,
we discuss synchronization and communication in detail. We explicitly
denote design choices to control trade-offs. A quantitative evaluation
based on the system VI S P L ORE shows fast visual feedback during
continuous interaction even for millions of entries. We describe
instantiations of our architecture in additional tools.</docText>

        <docText>Protovis: A Graphical Toolkit for
        Visualization

Despite myriad tools for visualizing data, there remains a gap
between the notational efficiency of high-level visualization systems
and the expressiveness and accessibility of low-level graphical systems.
Powerful visualization systems may be inflexible or impose abstractions
foreign to visual thinking, while graphical systems such as rendering
APIs and vector-based drawing programs are tedious for complex work. We
argue that an easy-to-use graphical system tailored for visualization is
needed. In response, we contribute Protovis, an extensible toolkit for
constructing visualizations by composing simple graphical primitives. In
Protovis, designers specify visualizations as a hierarchy of marks with
visual properties defined as functions of data. This representation
achieves a level of expressiveness comparable to low-level graphics
systems, while improving efficiency - the effort required to specify a
visualization - and accessibility - the effort required to learn and
modify the representation. We substantiate this claim through a diverse
collection of examples and comparative analysis with popular
visualization tools.</docText>

        <docText>Visual Analysis of Inter-Process Communication for Large-Scale
Parallel Computing

In serial computation, program profiling is often helpful for
optimization of key sections of code. When moving to parallel
computation, not only does the code execution need to be considered but
also communication between the different processes which can induce
delays that are detrimental to performance. As the number of processes
increases, so does the impact of the communication delays on
performance. For large-scale parallel applications, it is critical to
understand how the communication impacts performance in order to make
the code more efficient. There are several tools available for
visualizing program execution and communications on parallel systems.
These tools generally provide either views which statistically summarize
the entire program execution or process-centric views. However,
process-centric visualizations do not scale well as the number of
processes gets very large. In particular, the most common representation
of parallel processes is a Gantt chart with a row for each process. As
the number of processes increases, these charts can become difficult to
work with and can even exceed screen resolution. We propose a new
visualization approach that affords more scalability and then
demonstrate it on systems running with up to 16,384 processes.</docText>

        <docText>Participatory Visualization with Wordle

We discuss the design and usage of ldquoWordle,rdquo a
Web-based tool for visualizing text. Wordle creates tag-cloud-like
displays that give careful attention to typography, color, and
composition. We describe the algorithms used to balance various
aesthetic criteria and create the distinctive Wordle layouts. We then
present the results of a study of Wordle usage, based both on
spontaneous behaviour observed in the wild, and on a large-scale survey
of Wordle users. The results suggest that Wordles have become a kind of
medium of expression, and that a ldquoparticipatory culturerdquo has
arisen around them.</docText>

        <docText>Document Cards: A Top Trumps Visualization
        for Documents

Finding suitable, less space consuming views for a document's
main content is crucial to provide convenient access to large document
collections on display devices of different size. We present a novel
compact visualization which represents the document's key semantic as a
mixture of images and important key terms, similar to cards in a top
trumps game. The key terms are extracted using an advanced text mining
approach based on a fully automatic document structure extraction. The
images and their captions are extracted using a graphical heuristic and
the captions are used for a semi-semantic image weighting. Furthermore,
we use the image color histogram for classification and show at least
one representative from each non-empty image class. The approach is
demonstrated for the IEEE InfoVis publications of a complete year. The
method can easily be applied to other publication collections and sets
of documents which contain images.</docText>

        <docText>Visualizing the Intellectual Structure with Paper-Reference
Matrices

Visualizing the intellectual structure of scientific domains
using co-cited units such as references or authors has become a routine
for domain analysis. In previous studies, paper-reference matrices are
usually transformed into reference-reference matrices to obtain
co-citation relationships, which are then visualized in different
representations, typically as node-link networks, to represent the
intellectual structures of scientific domains. Such network
visualizations sometimes contain tightly knit components, which make
visual analysis of the intellectual structure a challenging task. In
this study, we propose a new approach to reveal co-citation
relationships. Instead of using a reference-reference matrix, we
directly use the original paper-reference matrix as the information
source, and transform the paper-reference matrix into an FP-tree and
visualize it in a Java-based prototype system. We demonstrate the
usefulness of our approach through visual analyses of the intellectual
structure of two domains: information visualization and Sloan Digital
Sky Survey (SDSS). The results show that our visualization not only
retains the major information of co-citation relationships, but also
reveals more detailed sub-structures of tightly knit clusters than a
conventional node-link network visualization.</docText>

        <docText>Exemplar-based Visualization of Large Document Corpus
(InfoVis2009-1115)

With the rapid growth of the World Wide Web and electronic
information services, text corpus is becoming available online at an
incredible rate. By displaying text data in a logical layout (e.g.,
color graphs), text visualization presents a direct way to observe the
documents as well as understand the relationship between them. In this
paper, we propose a novel technique, Exemplar-based visualization (EV),
to visualize an extremely large text corpus. Capitalizing on recent
advances in matrix approximation and decomposition, EV presents a
probabilistic multidimensional projection model in the low-rank text
subspace with a sound objective function. The probability of each
document proportion to the topics is obtained through iterative
optimization and embedded to a low dimensional space using parameter
embedding. By selecting the representative exemplars, we obtain a
compact approximation of the data. This makes the visualization highly
efficient and flexible. In addition, the selected exemplars neatly
summarize the entire data set and greatly reduce the cognitive overload
in the visualization, leading to an easier interpretation of large text
corpus. Empirically, we demonstrate the superior performance of EV
through extensive experiments performed on the publicly available text
data sets.</docText>

        <docText>Mapping Text with Phrase Nets

We present a new technique, the phrase net, for generating
visual overviews of unstructured text. A phrase net displays a graph
whose nodes are words and whose edges indicate that two words are linked
by a user-specified relation. These relations may be defined either at
the syntactic or lexical level; different relations often produce very
different perspectives on the same text. Taken together, these
perspectives often provide an illuminating visual overview of the key
concepts and relations in a document or set of documents.</docText>

        <docText>Interactive visual clustering of large
        collections of trajectories

One of the most common operations in exploration and analysis
of various kinds of data is clustering, i.e. discovery and
interpretation of groups of objects having similar properties and/or
behaviors. In clustering, objects are often treated as points in
multi-dimensional space of properties. However, structurally complex
objects, such as trajectories of moving entities and other kinds of
spatio-temporal data, cannot be adequately represented in this manner.
Such data require sophisticated and computationally intensive clustering
algorithms, which are very hard to scale effectively to large datasets
not fitting in the computer main memory. We propose an approach to
extracting meaningful clusters from large databases by combining
clustering and classification, which are driven by a human analyst
through an interactive visual interface.</docText>

        <docText>Proximity-based visualization of movement
        trace data

The increasing availability of motion sensors and video
cameras in living spaces has made possible the analysis of motion
patterns and collective behavior in a number of situations. The
visualization of this movement data, however, remains a challenge.
Although maintaining the actual layout of the data space is often
desirable, direct visualization of movement traces becomes cluttered and
confusing as the spatial distribution of traces may be disparate and
uneven. We present proximity-based visualization as a novel approach to
the visualization of movement traces in an abstract space rather than
the given spatial layout. This abstract space is obtained by considering
proximity data, which is computed as the distance between entities and
some number of important locations. These important locations can range
from a single fixed point, to a moving point, several points, or even
the proximities between the entities themselves. This creates a
continuum of proximity spaces, ranging from the fixed absolute reference
frame to completely relative reference frames. By combining these
abstracted views with the concrete spatial views, we provide a way to
mentally map the abstract spaces back to the real space. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of this approach, and its applicability to visual
analytics problems such as hazard prevention, migration patterns, and
behavioral studies.</docText>

        <docText>Guided analysis of hurricane trends using statistical processes
integrated with interactive parallel coordinates

This paper demonstrates the promise of augmenting interactive
multivariate representations with information from statistical processes
in the domain of weather data analysis. Statistical regression,
correlation analysis, and descriptive statistical calculations are
integrated via graphical indicators into an enhanced parallel
coordinates system, called the Multidimensional Data eXplorer (MDX).
These statistical indicators, which highlight significant associations
in the data, are complemented with interactive visual analysis
capabilities. The resulting system allows a smooth, interactive, and
highly visual workflow. The system's utility is demonstrated with an
extensive hurricane climate study that was conducted by a hurricane
expert. In the study, the expert used a new data set of environmental
weather data, composed of 28 independent variables, to predict annual
hurricane activity. MDX shows the Atlantic Meridional Mode increases the
explained variance of hurricane seasonal activity by 7-15&#37; and removes
less significant variables used in earlier studies. The findings and
feedback from the expert (1) validate the utility of the data set for
hurricane prediction, and (2) indicate that the integration of
statistical processes with interactive parallel coordinates, as
implemented in MDX, addresses both deficiencies in traditional weather
data analysis and exhibits some of the expected benefits of visual data
analysis.</docText>

        <docText>Finding comparable temporal categorical records: A similarity
measure with an interactive visualization

An increasing number of temporal categorical databases are
being collected: Electronic Health Records in healthcare organizations,
traffic incident logs in transportation systems, or student records in
universities. Finding similar records within these large databases
requires effective similarity measures that capture the searcher's
intent. Many similarity measures exist for numerical time series, but
temporal categorical records are different. We propose a temporal
categorical similarity measure, the M&amp;M (Match &amp; Mismatch) measure,
which is based on the concept of aligning records by sentinel events,
then matching events between the target and the compared records. The
M&amp;M measure combines the time differences between pairs of events and
the number of mismatches. To accom-modate customization of parameters in
the M&amp;M measure and results interpretation, we implemented Similan, an
interactive search and visualization tool for temporal categorical
records. A usability study with 8 participants demonstrated that Similan
was easy to learn and enabled them to find similar records, but users
had difficulty understanding the M&amp;M measure. The usability study
feedback, led to an improved version with a continuous timeline, which
was tested in a pilot study with 5 participants.</docText>

        <docText>A visual analytics system for radio frequency
fingerprinting-based localization

Radio frequency (RF) fingerprinting-based techniques for
localization are a promising approach for ubiquitous positioning
systems, particularly indoors. By finding unique fingerprints of RF
signals received at different locations within a predefined area
beforehand, whenever a similar fingerprint is subsequently seen again,
the localization system will be able to infer a user's current location.
However, developers of these systems face the problem of finding
reliable RF fingerprints that are unique enough and adequately stable
over time. We present a visual analytics system that enables developers
of these localization systems to visually gain insight on whether their
collected datasets and chosen fingerprint features have the necessary
properties to enable a reliable RF fingerprinting-based localization
system. The system was evaluated by testing and debugging an existing
localization system.</docText>

        <docText>Geovisual analytics for self-organizing
        network data

Cellular radio networks are continually growing in both node
count and complexity. It therefore becomes more difficult to manage the
networks and necessary to use time and cost effective automatic
algorithms to organize the networks neighbor cell relations. There have
been a number of attempts to develop such automatic algorithms. Network
operators, however, may not trust them because they need to have an
understanding of their behavior and of their reliability and
performance, which is not easily perceived. This paper presents a novel
Web-enabled geovisual analytics approach to exploration and
understanding of self-organizing network data related to cells and
neighbor cell relations. A demonstrator and case study are presented in
this paper, developed in close collaboration with the Swedish telecom
company Ericsson and based on large multivariate, time-varying and
geospatial data provided by the company. It allows the operators to
follow, interact with and analyze the evolution of a self-organizing
network and enhance their understanding of how an automatic algorithm
configures locally-unique physical cell identities and organizes
neighbor cell relations of the network. The geovisual analytics tool is
tested with a self-organizing network that is operated by the automatic
neighbor relations (ANR) algorithm. The demonstrator has been tested
with positive results by a group of domain experts from Ericsson and
will be tested in production.</docText>

        <docText>A framework for uncertainty-aware visual
        analytics

Visual analytics has become an important tool for gaining
insight on large and complex collections of data. Numerous statistical
tools and data transformations, such as projections, binning and
clustering, have been coupled with visualization to help analysts
understand data better and faster. However, data is inherently
uncertain, due to error, noise or unreliable sources. When making
decisions based on uncertain data, it is important to quantify and
present to the analyst both the aggregated uncertainty of the results
and the impact of the sources of that uncertainty. In this paper, we
present a new framework to support uncertainty in the visual analytics
process, through statistic methods such as uncertainty modeling,
propagation and aggregation. We show that data transformations, such as
regression, principal component analysis and k-means clustering, can be
adapted to account for uncertainty. This framework leads to better
visualizations that improve the decision-making process and help
analysts gain insight on the analytic process itself.</docText>

        <docText>Combining automated analysis and visualization techniques for
effective exploration of high-dimensional data

Visual exploration of multivariate data typically requires
projection onto lower-dimensional representations. The number of
possible representations grows rapidly with the number of dimensions,
and manual exploration quickly becomes ineffective or even unfeasible.
This paper proposes automatic analysis methods to extract potentially
relevant visual structures from a set of candidate visualizations. Based
on features, the visualizations are ranked in accordance with a
specified user task. The user is provided with a manageable number of
potentially useful candidate visualizations, which can be used as a
starting point for interactive data analysis. This can effectively ease
the task of finding truly useful visualizations and potentially speed up
the data exploration task. In this paper, we present ranking measures
for class-based as well as non class-based Scatterplots and Parallel
Coordinates visualizations. The proposed analysis methods are evaluated
on different datasets.</docText>

        <docText>Two-stage framework for visualization of clustered high
dimensional data

In this paper, we discuss dimension reduction methods for 2D
visualization of high dimensional clustered data. We propose a twostage
framework for visualizing such data based on dimension reduction
methods. In the first stage, we obtain the reduced dimensional data by
applying a supervised dimension reduction method such as linear
discriminant analysis which preserves the original cluster structure in
terms of its criteria. The resulting optimal reduced dimension depends
on the optimization criteria and is often larger than 2. In the second
stage, the dimension is further reduced to 2 for visualization purposes
by another dimension reduction method such as principal component
analysis. The role of the second-stage is to minimize the loss of
information due to reducing the dimension all the way to 2. Using this
framework, we propose several two-stage methods, and present their
theoretical characteristics as well as experimental comparisons on both
artificial and real-world text data sets.</docText>

        <docText>Model space visualization for multivariate
        linear trend discovery

Discovering and extracting linear trends and correlations in
datasets is very important for analysts to understand multivariate
phenomena. However, current widely used multivariate visualization
techniques, such as parallel coordinates and scatterplot matrices, fail
to reveal and illustrate such linear relationships intuitively,
especially when more than 3 variables are involved or multiple trends
coexist in the dataset. We present a novel multivariate model parameter
space visualization system that helps analysts discover single and
multiple linear patterns and extract subsets of data that fit a model
well. Using this system, analysts are able to explore and navigate in
model parameter space, interactively select and tune patterns, and
refine the model for accuracy using computational techniques. We build
connections between model space and data space visually, allowing
analysts to employ their domain knowledge during exploration to better
interpret the patterns they discover and their validity. Case studies
with real datasets are used to investigate the effectiveness of the
visualizations.</docText>

Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) is a commonly-used method for
automated processing, modeling, and analysis of unstructured text data.
One of the biggest challenges in using LSA is determining the
appropriate model parameters to use for different data domains and types
of analyses. Although automated methods have been developed to make rank
and scaling parameter choices, these approaches often make choices with
respect to noise in the data, without an understanding of how those
choices impact analysis and problem solving. Further, no tools currently
exist to explore the relationships between an LSA model and analysis
methods. Our work focuses on how parameter choices impact analysis and
problem solving. In this paper, we present LSAView, a system for
interactively exploring parameter choices for LSA models. We illustrate
the use of LSAView's small multiple views, linked matrix-graph views,
and data views to analyze parameter selection and application in the
context of graph layout and clustering.</docText>

        <docText>Parallel Tag Clouds to explore and analyze
        faceted text corpora

Do court cases differ from place to place? What kind of
picture do we get by looking at a country's collection of law cases? We
introduce parallel tag clouds: a new way to visualize differences
amongst facets of very large metadata-rich text corpora. We have pointed
parallel tag clouds at a collection of over 600,000 US Circuit Court
decisions spanning a period of 50 years and have discovered regional as
well as linguistic differences between courts. The visualization
technique combines graphical elements from parallel coordinates and
traditional tag clouds to provide rich overviews of a document
collection while acting as an entry point for exploration of individual
texts. We augment basic parallel tag clouds with a details-in-context
display and an option to visualize changes over a second facet of the
data, such as time. We also address text mining challenges such as
selecting the best words to visualize, and how to do so in reasonable
time periods to maintain interactivity.</docText>

        <docText>Describing story evolution from dynamic
        information streams

Sources of streaming information, such as news syndicates,
publish information continuously. Information portals and news
aggregators list the latest information from around the world enabling
information consumers to easily identify events in the past 24 hours.
The volume and velocity of these streams causes information from prior
days to quickly vanish despite its utility in providing an informative
context for interpreting new information. Few capabilities exist to
support an individual attempting to identify or understand trends and
changes from streaming information over time. The burden of retaining
prior information and integrating with the new is left to the skills,
determination, and discipline of each individual. In this paper we
present a visual analytics system for linking essential content from
information streams over time into dynamic stories that develop and
change over multiple days. We describe particular challenges to the
analysis of streaming information and present a fundamental visual
representation for showing story change and evolution over time.</docText>

literary text collections

A common task in literary analysis is to study characters in a

effective user interfaces facilitate character analysis. Using our
interface, called POSvis, the scholar uses word clouds and
self-organizing graphs to review vocabulary, to filter by part of
speech, and to explore the network of characters located near characters
under review. Further, visualizations show word usages within an

        <docText>VAST contest dataset use in education

The IEEE Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)
Symposium has held a contest each year since its inception in 2006.
These events are designed to provide visual analytics researchers and
developers with analytic challenges similar to those encountered by
professional information analysts. The VAST contest has had an extended
life outside of the symposium, however, as materials are being used in
universities and other educational settings, either to help teachers of
visual analytics-related classes or for student projects. We describe
how we develop VAST contest datasets that results in products that can
be used in different settings and review some specific examples of the
adoption of the VAST contest materials in the classroom. The examples
are drawn from graduate and undergraduate courses at Virginia Tech and
from the Visual Analytics ldquoSummer Camprdquo run by the National
Visualization and Analytics Center in 2008. We finish with a brief
discussion on evaluation metrics for education.</docText>

        <docText>Connecting the dots in visual analysis

During visual analysis, users must often connect insights
discovered at various points of time. This process is often called
ldquoconnecting the dots.rdquo When analysts interactively explore
complex datasets over multiple sessions, they may uncover a large number
of findings. As a result, it is often difficult for them to recall the
past insights, views and concepts that are most relevant to their
current line of inquiry. This challenge is even more difficult during
collaborative analysis tasks where they need to find connections between
their own discoveries and insights found by others. In this paper, we
describe a context-based retrieval algorithm to identify notes, views
and concepts from users' past analyses that are most relevant to a view
or a note based on their line of inquiry. We then describe a related
notes recommendation feature that surfaces the most relevant items to
the user as they work based on this algorithm. We have implemented this
recommendation feature in HARVEST, a Web based visual analytic system.
We evaluate the related notes recommendation feature of HARVEST through
a case study and discuss the implications of our approach.</docText>

        <docText>Capturing and supporting the analysis
        process

Visual analytics tools provide powerful visual representations
in order to support the sense-making process. In this process, analysts
typically iterate through sequences of steps many times, varying
parameters each time. Few visual analytics tools support this process
well, nor do they provide support for visualizing and understanding the
analysis process itself. To help analysts understand, explore,
reference, and reuse their analysis process, we present a visual
analytics system named CzSaw (See-Saw) that provides an editable and
re-playable history navigation channel in addition to multiple visual
representations of document collections and the entities within them (in
a manner inspired by Jigsaw). Conventional history navigation tools
range from basic undo and redo to branching timelines of user actions.
In CzSaw's approach to this, first, user interactions are translated
into a script language that drives the underlying scripting-driven
propagation system. The latter allows analysts to edit analysis steps,
and ultimately to program them. Second, on this base, we build both a
history view showing progress and alternative paths, and a dependency
graph showing the underlying logic of the analysis and dependency
relations among the results of each step. These tools result in a visual
model of the sense-making process, providing a way for analysts to
visualize their analysis process, to reinterpret the problem, explore
alternative paths, extract analysis patterns from existing history, and
reuse them with other related analyses.</docText>

        <docText>Evaluating visual analytics systems for investigative analysis:
Deriving design principles from a case study

Despite the growing number of systems providing visual
analytic support for investigative analysis, few empirical studies of
the potential benefits of such systems have been conducted, particularly
controlled, comparative evaluations. Determining how such systems foster
insight and sensemaking is important for their continued growth and
study, however. Furthermore, studies that identify how people use such
systems and why they benefit (or not) can help inform the design of new
systems in this area. We conducted an evaluation of the visual analytics
system Jigsaw employed in a small investigative sensemaking exercise,
and we compared its use to three other more traditional methods of
analysis. Sixteen participants performed a simulated intelligence
analysis task under one of the four conditions. Experimental results
suggest that Jigsaw assisted participants to analyze the data and
identify an embedded threat. We describe different analysis strategies
used by study participants and how computational support (or the lack
thereof) influenced the strategies. We then illustrate several
characteristics of the sensemaking process identified in the study and
provide design implications for investigative analysis tools based
thereon. We conclude with recommendations for metrics and techniques for
evaluating other visual analytics investigative analysis tools.</docText>

analytics

This paper presents a working graph analytics model that
embraces the strengths of the traditional top-down and bottom-up
approaches with a resilient crossover concept to exploit the vast
middle-ground information overlooked by the two extreme analytical
approaches. Our graph analytics model is co-developed by users and
researchers, who carefully studied the functional requirements that
reflect the critical thinking and interaction pattern of a real-life
intelligence analyst. To evaluate the model, we implement a system
prototype, known as GreenHornet, which allows our analysts to test the
theory in practice, identify the technological and usage-related gaps in
the model, and then adapt the new technology in their work space. The
paper describes the implementation of GreenHornet and compares its
strengths and weaknesses against the other prevailing models and tools.</docText>

        <docText>Visual analysis of graphs with multiple
        connected components

In this paper, we present a system for the interactive
visualization and exploration of graphs with many weakly connected
components. The visualization of large graphs has recently received much
research attention. However, specific systems for visual analysis of
graph data sets consisting of many components are rare. In our approach,
we rely on graph clustering using an extensive set of topology
descriptors. Specifically, we use the self-organizing-map algorithm in
conjunction with a user-adaptable combination of graph features for
clustering of graphs. It offers insight into the overall structure of
the data set. The clustering output is presented in a grid containing
clusters of the connected components of the input graph. Interactive
feature selection and task-tailored data views allow the exploration of
the whole graph space. The system provides also tools for assessment and
display of cluster quality. We demonstrate the usefulness of our system
by application to a shareholder network analysis problem based on a
large real-world data set. While so far our approach is applied to
weighted directed graphs only, it can be used for various graph types.</docText>

        <docText>MassVis: Visual analysis of protein complexes using mass
spectrometry

Protein complexes are formed when two or more proteins
non-covalently interact to form a larger three dimensional structure
with specific biological function. Understanding the composition of such
complexes is vital to understanding cell biology at the molecular level.
MassVis is a visual analysis tool designed to assist the interpretation
of data from a new workflow for detecting the composition of such
protein complexes in biological samples. The data generated by the
laboratory workflow naturally lends itself to a scatter plot
visualization. However, characteristics of this data give rise to some
unique aspects not typical of a standard scatter plot. We are able to
take the output from tandem mass spectrometry and render the data in
such a way that it mimics more traditional two-dimensional gel
techniques and at the same time reveals the correlated behavior
indicative of protein complexes. By computationally measuring these
correlated patterns in the data, membership in putative complexes can be
inferred. User interactions are provided to support both an interactive
discovery mode as well as an unsupervised clustering of likely
complexes. The specific analysis tasks led us to design a unique
arrangement of item selection and coordinated detail views in order to
simultaneously view different aspects of the selected item.</docText>

        <docText>Using projection and 2D plots to visually reveal genetic
mechanisms of complex human disorders

Gene mapping is a statistical method used to localize human
disease genes to particular regions of the human genome. When performing
such analysis, a genetic likelihood space is generated and sampled,
which results in a multidimensional scalar field. Researchers are
interested in exploring this likelihood space through the use of
visualization. Previous efforts at visualizing this space, though, were
slow and cumbersome, only showing a small portion of the space at a
time, thus requiring the user to keep a mental picture of several views.
We have developed a new technique that displays much more data at once
by projecting the multidimensional data into several 2D plots. One plot
is created for each parameter that shows the change along that
parameter. A radial projection is used to create another plot that
provides an overview of the high dimensional surface from the
perspective of a single point. Linking and brushing between all the
plots are used to determine relationships between parameters. We
demonstrate our techniques on real world autism data, showing how to
visually examine features of the high dimensional space.</docText>

        expression data

We present a new application, SpRay, designed for the visual
exploration of gene expression data. It is based on an extension and
adaption of parallel coordinates to support the visual exploration of
large and high-dimensional datasets. In particular, we investigate the
visual analysis of gene expression data as generated by micro-array
experiments; We combine refined visual exploration with statistical
methods to a visual analytics approach that proved to be particularly
successful in this application domain. We will demonstrate the

        <docText>Visual opinion analysis of customer
        feedback data

Today, online stores collect a lot of customer feedback in the
form of surveys, reviews, and comments. This feedback is categorized and
in some cases responded to, but in general it is underutilized - even
though customer satisfaction is essential to the success of their
business. In this paper, we introduce several new techniques to
interactively analyze customer comments and ratings to determine the
positive and negative opinions expressed by the customers. First, we
introduce a new discrimination-based technique to automatically extract
the terms that are the subject of the positive or negative opinion (such
as price or customer service) and that are frequently commented on.
Second, we derive a Reverse-Distance-Weighting method to map the
attributes to the related positive and negative opinions in the text.
Third, the resulting high-dimensional feature vectors are visualized in
a new summary representation that provides a quick overview. We also
cluster the reviews according to the similarity of the comments. Special
thumbnails are used to provide insight into the composition of the
clusters and their relationship. In addition, an interactive circular
correlation map is provided to allow analysts to detect the
relationships of the comments to other important attributes and the
scores. We have applied these techniques to customer comments from
real-world online stores and product reviews from web sites to identify
the strength and problems of different products and services, and show
the potential of our technique.</docText>

        <docText>FinVis: Applied visual analytics for
        personal financial planning

FinVis is a visual analytics tool that allows the non-expert
casual user to interpret the return, risk and correlation aspects of
financial data and make personal finance decisions. This interactive
exploratory tool helps the casual decision-maker quickly choose between
various financial portfolio options and view possible outcomes. FinVis
allows for exploration of inter-temporal data to analyze outcomes of
short-term or long-term investment decisions. FinVis helps the user
overcome cognitive limitations and understand the impact of correlation
between financial instruments in order to reap the benefits of portfolio
diversification. Because this software is accessible by non-expert
users, decision-makers from the general population can benefit greatly
from using FinVis in practical applications. We quantify the value of
FinVis using experimental economics methods and find that subjects using
the FinVis software make better financial portfolio decisions as
compared to subjects using a tabular version with the same information.
We also find that FinVis engages the user, which results in greater
exploration of the dataset and increased learning as compared to a
tabular display. Further, participants using FinVis reported increased
confidence in financial decision-making and noted that they were likely
to use this tool in practical application.</docText>

        <docText>Iterative integration of visual insights during patent search and
analysis

Patents are an important economic factor in todays globalized
markets. Therefore, the analysis of patent information has become an
inevitable task for a variety of interest groups. The retrieval of
relevant patent information is an integral part of almost every patent
analysis scenario. Unfortunately, the complexity of patent material
inhibits a straightforward retrieval of all relevant patent documents
and leads to iterative, time-consuming approaches in practice. With
`PatViz', a new system for interactive analysis of patent information
has been developed to leverage iterative query refinement. PatViz
supports users in building complex queries visually and in exploring
patent result sets interactively. Thereby, the visual query module
introduces an abstraction layer that provides uniform access to
different retrieval systems and relieves users of the burden to learn
different complex query languages. By establishing an integrated
environment it allows for interactive reintegration of insights gained
from visual result set exploration into the visual query representation.
We expect that the approach we have taken is also suitable to improve
iterative query refinement in other Visual Analytics systems.</docText>

        <docText>Balancing Systematic and Flexible Exploration of Social Networks

Social network analysis (SNA) has emerged as a powerful method for understanding the importance of relationships in networks. However, interactive exploration of networks is currently challenging because: (1) it is difficult to find patterns and comprehend the structure of networks with many nodes and links, and (2) current systems are often a medley of statistical methods and overwhelming visual output which leaves many analysts uncertain about how to explore in an orderly manner. This results in exploration that is largely opportunistic. Our contributions are techniques to help structural analysts understand social networks more effectively. We present SocialAction, a system that uses attribute ranking and coordinated views to help users systematically examine numerous SNA measures. Users can (1) flexibly iterate through visualizations of measures to gain an overview, filter nodes, and find outliers, (2) aggregate networks using link structure, find cohesive subgroups, and focus on communities of interest, and (3) untangle networks by viewing different link types separately, or find patterns across different link types using a matrix overview. For each operation, a stable node layout is maintained in the network visualization so users can make comparisons. SocialAction offers analysts a strategy beyond opportunism, as it provides systematic, yet flexible, techniques for exploring social networks</docText>

        <docText>Visual Analysis of Multivariate State Transition Graphs

We present a new approach for the visual analysis of state transition graphs. We deal with multivariate graphs where a number of attributes are associated with every node. Our method provides an interactive attribute-based clustering facility. Clustering results in metric, hierarchical and relational data, represented in a single visualization. To visualize hierarchically structured quantitative data, we introduce a novel technique: the bar tree. We combine this with a node-link diagram to visualize the hierarchy and an arc diagram to visualize relational data. Our method enables the user to gain significant insight into large state transition graphs containing tens of thousands of nodes. We illustrate the effectiveness of our approach by applying it to a real-world use case. The graph we consider models the behavior of an industrial wafer stepper and contains 55 043 nodes and 289 443 edges</docText>

        <docText>MatrixExplorer: a Dual-Representation System to Explore Social Networks

MatrixExplorer is a network visualization system that uses two representations: node-link diagrams and matrices. Its design comes from a list of requirements formalized after several interviews and a participatory design session conducted with social science researchers. Although matrices are commonly used in social networks analysis, very few systems support the matrix-based representations to visualize and analyze networks. MatrixExplorer provides several novel features to support the exploration of social networks with a matrix-based representation, in addition to the standard interactive filtering and clustering functions. It provides tools to reorder (layout) matrices, to annotate and compare findings across different layouts and find consensus among several clusterings. MatrixExplorer also supports node-link diagram views which are familiar to most users and remain a convenient way to publish or communicate exploration results. Matrix and node-link representations are kept synchronized at all stages of the exploration process</docText>

        <docText>Visual mining of multimedia data for social and behavioral studies

With advances in computing techniques, a large amount of high-resolution high-quality multimedia data (video and audio, etc.) has been collected in research laboratories in various scientific disciplines, particularly in social and behavioral studies. How to automatically and effectively discover new knowledge from rich multimedia data poses a compelling challenge since state-of-the-art data mining techniques can most often only search and extract pre-defined patterns or knowledge from complex heterogeneous data. In light of this, our approach is to take advantages of both the power of human perception system and the power of computational algorithms. More specifically, we propose an approach that allows scientists to use data mining as a first pass, and then forms a closed loop of visual analysis of current results followed by more data mining work inspired by visualization, the results of which can be in turn visualized and lead to the next round of visual exploration and analysis. In this way, new insights and hypotheses gleaned from the raw data and the current level of analysis can contribute to further analysis. As a first step toward this goal, we implement a visualization system with three critical components: (1) A smooth interface between visualization and data mining. The new analysis results can be automatically loaded into our visualization tool. (2) A flexible tool to explore and query temporal data derived from raw multimedia data. We represent temporal data into two forms - continuous variables and event variables. We have developed various ways to visualize both temporal correlations and statistics of multiple variables with the same type, and conditional and high-order statistics between continuous and event variables. (3) A seamless interface between raw multimedia data and derived data. Our visualization tool allows users to explore, compare, and analyze multi-stream derived variables and simultaneously switch to access raw multimedia data. We de- - monstrate various functions in our visualization program using a set of multimedia data including video, audio and motion tracking data.</docText>

        <docText>Multivariate visual explanation for high dimensional datasets

Understanding multivariate relationships is an important task in multivariate data analysis. Unfortunately, existing multivariate visualization systems lose effectiveness when analyzing relationships among variables that span more than a few dimensions. We present a novel multivariate visual explanation approach that helps users interactively discover multivariate relationships among a large number of dimensions by integrating automatic numerical differentiation techniques and multidimensional visualization techniques. The result is an efficient workflow for multivariate analysis model construction, interactive dimension reduction, and multivariate knowledge discovery leveraging both automatic multivariate analysis and interactive multivariate data visual exploration. Case studies and a formal user study with a real dataset illustrate the effectiveness of this approach.</docText>

        <docText>Generating hypotheses of trends in high-dimensional data skeletons

We seek an information-revealing representation for high-dimensional data distributions that may contain local trends in certain subspaces. Examples are data that have continuous support in simple shapes with identifiable branches. Such data can be represented by a graph that consists of segments of locally fit principal curves or surfaces summarizing each identifiable branch. We describe a new algorithm to find the optimal paths through such a principal graph. The paths are optimal in the sense that they represent the longest smooth trends through the data set, and jointly they cover the data set entirely with minimum overlap. The algorithm is suitable for hypothesizing trends in high-dimensional data, and can assist exploratory data analysis and visualization.</docText>

        <docText>The Scalable Reasoning System: Lightweight visualization for distributed analytics

A central challenge in visual analytics is the creation of accessible, widely distributable analysis applications that bring the benefits of visual discovery to as broad a user base as possible. Moreover, to support the role of visualization in the knowledge creation process, it is advantageous to allow users to describe the reasoning strategies they employ while interacting with analytic environments. We introduce an application suite called the Scalable Reasoning System (SRS), which provides web-based and mobile interfaces for visual analysis. The service-oriented analytic framework that underlies SRS provides a platform for deploying pervasive visual analytic environments across an enterprise. SRS represents a lightweight approach to visual analytics whereby thin client analytic applications can be rapidly deployed in a platform-agnostic fashion. Client applications support multiple coordinated views while giving analysts the ability to record evidence, assumptions, hypotheses and other reasoning artifacts. We describe the capabilities of SRS in the context of a real-world deployment at a regional law enforcement organization.</docText>

        <docText>Characterizing users visual analytic activity for insight provenance

Insight provenance?a historical record of the process and rationale by which an insight is derived?is an essential requirement in many visual analytics applications. While work in this area has relied on either manually recorded provenance (e.g., user notes) or automatically recorded event-based insight provenance (e.g., clicks, drags, and key-presses), both approaches have fundamental limitations. Our aim is to develop a new approach that combines the benefits of both approaches while avoiding their deficiencies. Toward this goal, we characterize users visual analytic activity at multiple levels of granularity. Moreover, we identify a critical level of abstraction, Actions, that can be used to represent visual analytic activity with a set of general but semantically meaningful behavior types. In turn, the action types can be used as the semantic building blocks for insight provenance. We present a catalog of common actions identified through observations of several different visual analytic systems. In addition, we define a taxonomy to categorize actions into three major classes based on their semantic intent. The concept of actions has been integrated into our labs prototype visual analytic system, HARVEST, as the basis for its insight provenance capabilities.</docText>

        <docText>Narratives: A visualization to track narrative events as they develop

Analyzing unstructured text streams can be challenging. One popular approach is to isolate specific themes in the text, and to visualize the connections between them. Some existing systems, like ThemeRiver, provide a temporal view of changes in themes; other systems, like In-Spire, use clustering techniques to help an analyst identify the themes at a single point in time. Narratives combines both of these techniques; it uses a temporal axis to visualize ways that concepts have changed over time, and introduces several methods to explore how those concepts relate to each other. Narratives is designed to help the user place news stories in their historical and social context by understanding how the major topics associated with them have changed over time. Users can relate articles through time by examining the topical keywords that summarize a specific news event. By tracking the attention to a news article in the form of references in social media (such as weblogs), a user discovers both important events and measures the social relevance of these stories.</docText>

        <docText>Applied visual analytics for economic decision-making

This paper introduces the application of visual analytics techniques as a novel approach for improving economic decision making. Particularly, we focus on two known problems where subjects behavior consistently deviates from the optimal, the Winners and Losers Curse. According to economists, subjects fail to recognize the profit-maximizing decision strategy in both the Winners and Losers curse because they are unable to properly consider all the available information. As such, we have created a visual analytics tool to aid subjects in decision making under the Acquiring a Company framework common in many economic experiments. We demonstrate the added value of visual analytics in the decision making process through a series of user studies comparing standard visualization methods with interactive visual analytics techniques. Our work presents not only a basis for development and evaluation of economic visual analytic research, but also empirical evidence demonstrating the added value of applying visual analytics to general decision making tasks.</docText>

        <docText>Entity-based collaboration tools for intelligence analysis

Software tools that make it easier for analysts to collaborate as a natural part of their work will lead to better analysis that is informed by more perspectives. We are interested to know if software tools can be designed that support collaboration even as they allow analysts to find documents and organize information (including evidence, schemas, and hypotheses). We have modified the Entity Workspace system, described previously, to test such designs. We have evaluated the resulting design in both a laboratory study and a study where it is situated with an analysis team. In both cases, effects on collaboration appear to be positive. Key aspects of the design include an evidence notebook optimized for organizing entities (rather than text characters), information structures that can be collapsed and expanded, visualization of evidence that emphasizes events and documents (rather than emphasizing the entity graph), and a notification system that finds entities of mutual interest to multiple analyst.</docText>

        <docText>Visual analytics for complex concepts using a human cognition model

As the information being visualized and the process of understanding that information both become increasingly complex, it is necessary to develop new visualization approaches that facilitate the flow of human reasoning. In this paper, we endeavor to push visualization design a step beyond current user models by discussing a modeling framework of human higher cognition. Based on this cognition model, we present design guidelines for the development of visual interfaces designed to maximize the complementary cognitive strengths of both human and computer. Some of these principles are already being reflected in the better visual analytics designs, while others have not yet been applied or fully applied. But none of the guidelines have explained the deeper rationale that the model provides. Lastly, we discuss and assess these visual analytics guidelines through the evaluation of several visualization examples.</docText>

        <docText>Evaluating the relationship between user interaction and financial visual analysis

It has been widely accepted that interactive visualization techniques enable users to more effectively form hypotheses and identify areas for more detailed investigation. There have been numerous empirical user studies testing the effectiveness of specific visual analytical tools. However, there has been limited effort in connecting a users interaction with his reasoning for the purpose of extracting the relationship between the two. In this paper, we present an approach for capturing and analyzing user interactions in a financial visual analytical tool and describe an exploratory user study that examines these interaction strategies. To achieve this goal, we created two visual tools to analyze raw interaction data captured during the user session. The results of this study demonstrate one possible strategy for understanding the relationship between interaction and reasoning both operationally and strategically.</docText>

        <docText>Collaborative synthesis of visual analytic results

Visual analytic tools allow analysts to generate large collections of useful analytical results. We anticipate that analysts in most real world situations will draw from these collections when working together to solve complicated problems. This indicates a need to understand how users synthesize multiple collections of results. This paper reports the results of collaborative synthesis experiments conducted with expert geographers and disease biologists. Ten participants were worked in pairs to complete a simulated real-world synthesis task using artifacts printed on cards on a large, paper-covered workspace. Experiment results indicate that groups use a number of different approaches to collaborative synthesis, and that they employ a variety of organizational metaphors to structure their information. It is further evident that establishing common ground and role assignment are critical aspects of collaborative synthesis. We conclude with a set of general design guidelines for collaborative synthesis support tools.</docText>

        <docText>Maintaining interactivity while exploring massive time series

The speed of data retrieval qualitatively affects how analysts visually explore and analyze their data. To ensure smooth interactions in massive time series datasets, one needs to address the challenges of computing ad hoc queries, distributing query load, and hiding system latency. In this paper, we present ATLAS, a visualization tool for temporal data that addresses these issues using a combination of high performance database technology, predictive caching, and level of detail management. We demonstrate ATLAS using commodity hardware on a network traffic dataset of more than a billion records.</docText>

        <docText>Spatio-temporal aggregation for visual analysis of movements

Data about movements of various objects are collected in growing amounts by means of current tracking technologies. Traditional approaches to visualization and interactive exploration of movement data cannot cope with data of such sizes. In this research paper we investigate the ways of using aggregation for visual analysis of movement data. We define aggregation methods suitable for movement data and find visualization and interaction techniques to represent results of aggregations and enable comprehensive exploration of the data. We consider two possible views of movement, traffic-oriented and trajectory-oriented. Each view requires different methods of analysis and of data aggregation. We illustrate our argument with example data resulting from tracking multiple cars in Milan and example analysis tasks from the domain of city traffic management.</docText>

Social network graphs, concept maps, and process charts are examples of diagrammatic representations employed by intelligence analysts to understand complex systems. Unfortunately, these 2D representations currently do not easily convey the flow, sequence, tempo and other important dynamic behaviors within these systems. In this paper we present Configurable Spaces, a novel analytical method for visualizing patterns of activity over time in complex diagrammatically-represented systems. Configurable Spaces extends GeoTimes X, Y, T coordinate workspace space for temporal analysis to any arbitrary diagrammatic work space by replacing a geographic map with a diagram.</docText>

        <docText>Understanding syndromic hotspots - a visual analytics approach

When analyzing syndromic surveillance data, health care officials look for areas with unusually high cases of syndromes. Unfortunately, many outbreaks are difficult to detect because their signal is obscured by the statistical noise. Consequently, many detection algorithms have a high false positive rate. While many false alerts can be easily filtered by trained epidemiologists, others require health officials to drill down into the data, analyzing specific segments of the population and historical trends over time and space. Furthermore, the ability to accurately recognize meaningful patterns in the data becomes more challenging as these data sources increase in volume and complexity. To facilitate more accurate and efficient event detection, we have created a visual analytics tool that provides analysts with linked geo-spatiotemporal and statistical analytic views. We model syndromic hotspots by applying a kernel density estimation on the population sample. When an analyst selects a syndromic hotspot, temporal statistical graphs of the hotspot are created. Similarly, regions in the statistical plots may be selected to generate geospatial features specific to the current time period. Demographic filtering can then be combined to determine if certain populations are more affected than others. These tools allow analysts to perform real-time hypothesis testing and evaluation.</docText>

        <docText>Using visual analytics to maintain situation awareness in astrophysics

We present a novel collaborative visual analytics application for cognitively overloaded users in the astrophysics domain. The system was developed for scientists needing to analyze heterogeneous, complex data under time pressure, and then make predictions and time-critical decisions rapidly and correctly under a constant influx of changing data. The Sunfall Data Taking system utilizes several novel visualization and analysis techniques to enable a team of geographically distributed domain specialists to effectively and remotely maneuver a custom-built instrument under challenging operational conditions. Sunfall Data Taking has been in use for over eighteen months by a major international astrophysics collaboration (the largest data volume supernova search currently in operation), and has substantially improved the operational efficiency of its users. We describe the system design process by an interdisciplinary team, the system architecture, and the results of an informal usability evaluation of the production system by domain experts in the context of Endsleys three levels of situation awareness [1].</docText>

        <docText>Model-driven Visual Analytics

We describe a Visual Analytics (VA) infrastructure, rooted on techniques in machine learning and logic-based deductive reasoning that will assist analysts to make sense of large, complex data sets by facilitating the generation and validation of models representing relationships in the data. We use Logic Programming (LP) as the underlying computing machinery to encode the relations as rules and facts and compute with them. A unique aspect of our approach is that the LP rules are automatically learned, using Inductive Logic Programming, from examples of data that the analyst deems interesting when viewing the data in the high-dimensional visualization interface. Using this system, analysts will be able to construct models of arbitrary relationships in the data, explore the data for scenarios that fit the model, refine the model if necessary, and query the model to automatically analyze incoming (future) data exhibiting the encoded relationships. In other words it will support both model-driven data exploration, as well as data-driven model evolution. More importantly, by basing the construction of models on techniques from machine learning and logic-based deduction, the VA process will be both flexible in terms of modeling arbitrary, user-driven relationships in the data as well as readily scale across different data domains.</docText>

        <docText>Crystal structures classifier for an evolutionary algorithm structure predictor

USPEX is a crystal structure predictor based on an evolutionary algorithm. Every USPEX run produces hundreds or thousands of crystal structures, some of which may be identical. To ease the extraction of unique and potentially interesting structures we applied usual high-dimensional classification concepts to the unusual field of crystallography. We experimented with various crystal structure descriptors, distinct distance measures and tried different clustering methods to identify groups of similar structures. These methods are already applied in combinatorial chemistry to organic molecules for a different goal and in somewhat different forms, but are not widely used for crystal structures classification. We adopted a visual design and validation method in the development of a library (CrystalFp) and an end-user application to select and validate method choices, to gain users acceptance and to tap into their domain expertise. The use of the classifier has already accelerated the analysis of USPEX output by at least one order of magnitude, promoting some new crystallographic insight and discovery. Furthermore the visual display of key algorithm indicators has led to diverse, unexpected discoveries that will improve the USPEX algorithms.</docText>

        <docText>Visual cluster analysis of trajectory data with interactive Kohonen Maps

Visual-interactive cluster analysis provides valuable tools for effectively analyzing large and complex data sets. Due to desirable properties and an inherent predisposition for visualization, the Kohonen Feature Map (or Self-Organizing Map, or SOM) algorithm is among the most popular and widely used visual clustering techniques. However, the unsupervised nature of the algorithm may be disadvantageous in certain applications. Depending on initialization and data characteristics, cluster maps (cluster layouts) may emerge that do not comply with user preferences, expectations, or the application context. Considering SOM-based analysis of trajectory data, we propose a comprehensive visual-interactive monitoring and control framework extending the basic SOM algorithm. The framework implements the general Visual Analytics idea to effectively combine automatic data analysis with human expert supervision. It provides simple, yet effective facilities for visually monitoring and interactively controlling the trajectory clustering process at arbitrary levels of detail. The approach allows the user to leverage existing domain knowledge and user preferences, arriving at improved cluster maps. We apply the framework on a trajectory clustering problem, demonstrating its potential in combining both unsupervised (machine) and supervised (human expert) processing, in producing appropriate cluster results.</docText>

        <docText>Expand-Ahead: A Space-Filling Strategy for Browsing Trees

Many tree browsers allow subtrees under a node to be collapsed or expanded, enabling the user to control screen space usage and selectively drill-down. However, explicit expansion of nodes can be tedious. Expand-ahead is a space-filling strategy by which some nodes are automatically expanded to fill available screen space, without expanding so far that nodes are shown at a reduced size or outside the viewport. This often allows a user exploring the tree to see further down the tree without the effort required in a traditional browser. It also means the user can sometimes drill-down a path faster, by skipping over levels of the tree that are automatically expanded for them. Expand-ahead differs from many detail-in-context techniques in that there is no scaling or distortion involved. We present 1D and 2D prototype implementations of expand-ahead, and identify various design issues and possible enhancements to our designs. Our prototypes support smooth, animated transitions between different views of a tree. We also present the results of a controlled experiment which show that, under certain conditions, users are able to drill-down faster with expand-ahead than without</docText>

Color is often used to convey information, and color compositing is often required while visualizing multiattribute information. This paper proposes an alternative method for color compositing. In order to present understandable color blending to the general public, several techniques are proposed. First, a paint-inspired RYB color space is used. In addition, noise patterns are employed to produce subregions of pure color within an overlapped region. We show examples to demonstrate the effectiveness of our technique for visualization</docText>

We present Artifacts of the Presence Era, a digital installation that uses a geological metaphor to visualize the events in a physical space over time. The piece captures video and audio from a museum and constructs an impressionistic visualization of the evolving history in the space. Instead of creating a visualization tool for data analysis, we chose to produce a piece that functions as a souvenir of a particular time and place. We describe the design choices we made in creating this installation, the visualization techniques we developed, and the reactions we observed from users and the media. We suggest that the same approach can be applied to a more general set of visualization contexts, ranging from email archives to newsgroups conversations</docText>

        <docText>Time-Varying Data Visualization Using Information Flocking Boids

This research demonstrates how principles of self-organization and behavior simulation can be used to represent dynamic data evolutions by extending the concept of information flocking, originally introduced by Proctor &amp; Winter (1998), to time-varying datasets. A rule-based behavior system continuously controls and updates the dynamic actions of individual, three-dimensional elements that represent the changing data values of reoccurring data objects. As a result, different distinguishable motion types emerge that are driven by local interactions between the spatial elements as well as the evolution of time-varying data values. Notably, this representation technique focuses on the representation of dynamic data alteration characteristics, or how reoccurring data objects change over time, instead of depicting the exact data values themselves. In addition, it demonstrates the potential of motion as a useful information visualization cue. The original information flocking approach is extended to incorporate time-varying datasets, live database querying, continuous data streaming, real-time data similarity evaluation, automatic shape generation and more stable flocking algorithms. Different experiments prove that information flocking is capable of representing short-term events as well as long-term temporal data evolutions of both individual and groups of time-dependent data objects. An historical stock market quote price dataset is used to demonstrate the algorithms and principles of time-varying information flocking</docText>

        <docText>Clutter Reduction in Multi-Dimensional Data Visualization Using Dimension Reordering

Visual clutter denotes a disordered collection of graphical entities in information visualization. Clutter can obscure the structure present in the data. Even in a small dataset, clutter can make it hard for the viewer to find patterns, relationships and structure. In this paper, we define visual clutter as any aspect of the visualization that interferes with the viewer's understanding of the data, and present the concept of clutter-based dimension reordering. Dimension order is an attribute that can significantly affect a visualization's expressiveness. By varying the dimension order in a display, it is possible to reduce clutter without reducing information content or modifying the data in any way. Clutter reduction is a display-dependent task. In this paper, we follow a three-step procedure for four different visualization techniques. For each display technique, first, we determine what constitutes clutter in terms of display properties; then we design a metric to measure visual clutter in this display; finally we search for an order that minimizes the clutter in a display</docText>

        <docText>Uncovering Clusters in Crowded Parallel Coordinates Visualizations

The one-to-one strategy of mapping each single data item into a graphical marker adopted in many visualization techniques has limited usefulness when the number of records and/or the dimensionality of the data set are very high. In this situation, the strong overlapping of graphical markers severely hampers the user's ability to identify patterns in the data from its visual representation. We tackle this problem here with a strategy that computes frequency or density information from the data set, and uses such information in parallel coordinates visualizations to filter out the information to be presented to the user, thus reducing visual clutter and allowing the analyst to observe relevant patterns in the data. The algorithms to construct such visualizations, and the interaction mechanisms supported, inspired by traditional image processing techniques such as grayscale manipulation and thresholding are also presented. We also illustrate how such algorithms can assist users to effectively identify clusters in very noisy large data sets</docText>

        <docText>Value and Relation Display for Interactive Exploration of High Dimensional Datasets

Traditional multidimensional visualization techniques, such as glyphs, parallel coordinates and scatterplot matrices, suffer from clutter at the display level and difficult user navigation among dimensions when visualizing high dimensional datasets. In this paper, we propose a new multidimensional visualization technique named a value and relation (VaR) display, together with a rich set of navigation and selection tools, for interactive exploration of datasets with up to hundreds of dimensions. By explicitly conveying the relationships among the dimensions of a high dimensional dataset, the VaR display helps users grasp the associations among dimensions. By using pixel-oriented techniques to present values of the data items in a condensed manner, the VaR display reveals data patterns in the dataset using as little screen space as possible. The navigation and selection tools enable users to interactively reduce clutter, navigate within the dimension space, and examine data value details within context effectively and efficiently. The VaR display scales well to datasets with large numbers of data items by employing sampling and texture mapping. A case study on a real dataset, as well as the VaR displays of multiple real datasets throughout the paper, reveals how our proposed approach helps users interactively explore high dimensional datasets with large numbers of data items</docText>

        <docText>A Rank-by-Feature Framework for Unsupervised Multidimensional Data Exploration Using Low Dimensional Projections

Exploratory analysis of multidimensional data sets is challenging because of the difficulty in comprehending more than three dimensions. Two fundamental statistical principles for the exploratory analysis are (1) to examine each dimension first and then find relationships among dimensions, and (2) to try graphical displays first and then find numerical summaries (D.S. Moore, (1999). We implement these principles in a novel conceptual framework called the rank-by-feature framework. In the framework, users can choose a ranking criterion interesting to them and sort 1D or 2D axis-parallel projections according to the criterion. We introduce the rank-by-feature prism that is a color-coded lower-triangular matrix that guides users to desired features. Statistical graphs (histogram, boxplot, and scatterplot) and information visualization techniques (overview, coordination, and dynamic query) are combined to help users effectively traverse 1D and 2D axis-parallel projections, and finally to help them interactively find interesting features</docText>

        <docText>Steerable, Progressive Multidimensional Scaling

Current implementations of multidimensional scaling (MDS), an approach that attempts to best represent data point similarity in a low-dimensional representation, are not suited for many of today's large-scale datasets. We propose an extension to the spring model approach that allows the user to interactively explore datasets that are far beyond the scale of previous implementations of MDS. We present MDSteer, a steerable MDS computation engine and visualization tool that progressively computes an MDS layout and handles datasets of over one million points. Our technique employs hierarchical data structures and progressive layouts to allow the user to steer the computation of the algorithm to the interesting areas of the dataset. The algorithm iteratively alternates between a layout stage in which a subselection of points are added to the set of active points affected by the MDS iteration, and a binning stage which increases the depth of the bin hierarchy and organizes the currently unplaced points into separate spatial regions. This binning strategy allows the user to select onscreen regions of the layout to focus the MDS computation into the areas of the dataset that are assigned to the selected bins. We show both real and common synthetic benchmark datasets with dimensionalities ranging from 3 to 300 and cardinalities of over one million points</docText>

        <docText>A History Mechanism for Visual Data Mining

A major challenge of current visualization and visual data mining (VDM) frameworks is to support users in the orientation in complex visual mining scenarios. An important aspect to increase user support and user orientation is to use a history mechanism that, first of all, provides un- and redoing functionality. In this paper, we present a new approach to include such history functionality into a VDM framework. Therefore, we introduce the theoretical background, outline design and implementation aspects of a history management unit, and conclude with a discussion showing the usefulness of our history management in a VDM framework</docText>

        <docText>DataMeadow: A Visual Canvas for Analysis of Large-Scale Multivariate Data

Supporting visual analytics of multiple large-scale multidimensional datasets requires a high degree of interactivity and user control beyond the conventional challenges of visualizing such datasets. We present the DataMeadow, a visual canvas providing rich interaction for constructing visual queries using graphical set representations called DataRoses. A DataRose is essentially a starplot of selected columns in a dataset displayed as multivariate visualizations with dynamic query sliders integrated into each axis. The purpose of the DataMeadow is to allow users to create advanced visual queries by iteratively selecting and filtering into the multidimensional data. Furthermore, the canvas provides a clear history of the analysis that can be annotated to facilitate dissemination of analytical results to outsiders. Towards this end, the DataMeadow has a direct manipulation interface for selection, filtering, and creation of sets, subsets, and data dependencies using both simple and complex mouse gestures. We have evaluated our system using a qualitative expert review involving two researchers working in the area. Results from this review are favorable for our new method.</docText>

        <docText>Visual Analysis of Controversy in User-generated Encyclopedias

Wikipedia is a large and rapidly growing Web-based collaborative authoring environment, where anyone on the Internet can create, modify, and delete pages about encyclopedic topics. A remarkable property of some Wikipedia pages is that they are written by up to thousands of authors who may have contradicting opinions. In this paper we show that a visual analysis of the "who revises whom"- network gives deep insight into controversies. We propose a set of analysis and visualization techniques that reveal the dominant authors of a page, the roles they play, and the alters they confront. Thereby we provide tools to understand how Wikipedia authors collaborate in the presence of controversy.</docText>

        <docText>Design Considerations for Collaborative Visual Analytics

Information visualization leverages the human visual system to support the process of sensemaking, in which information is collected, organized, and analyzed to generate knowledge and inform action. Though most research to date assumes a single-user focus on perceptual and cognitive processes, in practice, sensemaking is often a social process involving parallelization of effort, discussion, and consensus building. This suggests that to fully support sensemaking, interactive visualization should also support social interaction. However, the most appropriate collaboration mechanisms for supporting this interaction are not immediately clear. In this article, we present design considerations for asynchronous collaboration in visual analysis environments, highlighting issues of work parallelization, communication, and social organization. These considerations provide a guide for the design and evaluation of collaborative visualization systems.</docText>

        <docText>Us vs. Them: Understanding Social Dynamics in Wikipedia with Revert Graph Visualizations

Wikipedia is a wiki-based encyclopedia that has become one of the most popular collaborative on-line knowledge systems. As in any large collaborative system, as Wikipedia has grown, conflicts and coordination costs have increased dramatically. Visual analytic tools provide a mechanism for addressing these issues by enabling users to more quickly and effectively make sense of the status of a collaborative environment. In this paper we describe a model for identifying patterns of conflicts in Wikipedia articles. The model relies on users' editing history and the relationships between user edits, especially revisions that void previous edits, known as "reverts". Based on this model, we constructed Revert Graph, a tool that visualizes the overall conflict patterns between groups of users. It enables visual analysis of opinion groups and rapid interactive exploration of those relationships via detail drill- downs. We present user patterns and case studies that show the effectiveness of these techniques, and discuss how they could generalize to other systems.</docText>

        <docText>Visualizing Incomplete and Partially Ranked Data

Ranking data, which result from m raters ranking n items, are difficult to visualize due to their discrete algebraic structure, and the computational difficulties associated with them when n is large. This problem becomes worse when raters provide tied rankings or not all items are ranked. We develop an approach for the visualization of ranking data for large n which is intuitive, easy to use, and computationally efficient. The approach overcomes the structural and computational difficulties by utilizing a natural measure of dissimilarity for raters, and projecting the raters into a low dimensional vector space where they are viewed. The visualization techniques are demonstrated using voting data, jokes, and movie preferences.</docText>

In this paper we present EZEL, a visual tool we developed for the performance assessment of peer-to-peer file-sharing networks. We start by identifying the relevant data transferred in this kind of networks and the main performance assessment questions. Then we describe the visualization of data from two different points of view. First we take servers as focal points and we introduce a new technique, faded cushioning, which allows visualizing the same data from different perspectives. Secondly, we present the viewpoint of files, and we expose the correlations with the server stance via a special scatter plot. Finally, we discuss how our tool, based on the described techniques, is effective in the performance assessment of peer-to-peer file-sharing networks</docText>

        <docText>RecMap: Rectangular Map Approximations

In many application domains, data is collected and referenced by its geospatial location. Nowadays, different kinds of maps are used to emphasize the spatial distribution of one or more geospatial attributes. The nature of geospatial statistical data is the highly nonuniform distribution in the real world data sets. This has several impacts on the resulting map visualizations. Classical area maps tend to highlight patterns in large areas, which may, however, be of low importance. Cartographers and geographers used cartograms or value-by-area maps to address this problem long before computers were available. Although many automatic techniques have been developed, most of the value-by-area cartograms are generated manually via human interaction. In this paper, we propose a novel visualization technique for geospatial data sets called RecMap. Our technique approximates a rectangular partition of the (rectangular) display area into a number of map regions preserving important geospatial constraints. It is a fully automatic technique with explicit user control over all exploration constraints within the exploration process. Experiments show that our technique produces visualizations of geospatial data sets, which enhance the discovery of global and local correlations, and demonstrate its performance in a variety of applications</docText>

Analyzing observations over time and geography is a common task but typically requires multiple, separate tools. The objective of our research has been to develop a method to visualize, and work with, the spatial interconnectedness of information over time and geography within a single, highly interactive 3D view. A novel visualization technique for displaying and tracking events, objects and activities within a combined temporal and geospatial display has been developed. This technique has been implemented as a demonstratable prototype called GeoTime in order to determine potential utility. Initial evaluations have been with military users. However, we believe the concept is applicable to a variety of government and business analysis tasks</docText>

In this paper, we describe a taxonomy of generic graph related tasks and an evaluation aiming at assessing the readability of two representations of graphs: matrix-based representations and node-link diagrams. This evaluation bears on seven generic tasks and leads to important recommendations with regard to the representation of graphs according to their size and density. For instance, we show that when graphs are bigger than twenty vertices, the matrix-based visualization performs better than node-link diagrams on most tasks. Only path finding is consistently in favor of node-link diagrams throughout the evaluation</docText>

This paper describes a comparative experiment with five well-known tree visualization systems, and Windows Explorer as a baseline system. Subjects performed tasks relating to the structure of a directory hierarchy, and to attributes of files and directories. Task completion times, correctness and user satisfaction were measured, and video recordings of subjects' interaction with the systems were made. Significant system and task type effects and an interaction between system and task type were found. Qualitative analyses of the video recordings were thereupon conducted to determine reasons for the observed differences, resulting in several findings and design recommendations as well as implications for future experiments with tree visualization systems</docText>

        <docText>An Evaluation of Microarray Visualization Tools for Biological Insight

High-throughput experiments such as gene expression microarrays in the life sciences result in large datasets. In response, a wide variety of visualization tools have been created to facilitate data analysis. Biologists often face a dilemma in choosing the best tool for their situation. The tool that works best for one biologist may not work well for another due to differences in the type of insight they seek from their data. A primary purpose of a visualization tool is to provide domain-relevant insight into the data. Ideally, any user wants maximum information in the least possible time. In this paper we identify several distinct characteristics of insight that enable us to recognize and quantify it. Based on this, we empirically evaluate five popular microarray visualization tools. Our conclusions can guide biologists in selecting the best tool for their data, and computer scientists in developing and evaluating visualizations</docText>

        <docText>Lighthouse: showing the way to relevant information

Lighthouse is an on-line interface for a Web-based information retrieval system. It accepts queries from a user, collects the retrieved documents from the search engine, organizes and presents them to the user. The system integrates two known presentations of the retrieved results, the ranked list and clustering visualization, in a novel and effective way. It accepts the user's input and adjusts the document visualization accordingly. We give a brief overview of the system</docText>

        <docText>ThemeRiver: visualizing theme changes over time

ThemeRiverTM is a prototype system that visualizes thematic variations over time within a large collection of documents. The river flows from left to right through time, changing width to depict changes in thematic strength of temporally associated documents. Colored currents flowing within the river narrow or widen to indicate decreases or increases in the strength of an individual topic or a group of topics in the associated documents. The river is shown within the context of a timeline and a corresponding textual presentation of external events</docText>

        <docText>Visualizing sequential patterns for text mining

A sequential pattern in data mining is a finite series of elements such as ABCD where A, B, C, and D are elements of the same domain. The mining of sequential patterns is designed to find patterns of discrete events that frequently happen in the same arrangement along a timeline. Like association and clustering, the mining of sequential patterns is among the most popular knowledge discovery techniques that apply statistical measures to extract useful information from large datasets. As out computers become more powerful, we are able to mine bigger datasets and obtain hundreds of thousands of sequential patterns in full detail. With this vast amount of data, we argue that neither data mining nor visualization by itself can manage the information and reflect the knowledge effectively. Subsequently, we apply visualization to augment data mining in a study of sequential patterns in large text corpora. The result shows that we can learn more and more quickly in an integrated visual data-mining environment</docText>

With an increase in the number of different visualization techniques, it becomes necessary to develop a measure for evaluating the effectiveness of visualizations.

        <docText>From metaphor to method: cartographic perspectives on information visualization

By virtue of their spatio-cognitive abilities, humans are able to navigate through geographic space as well as meaningfully communicate geographic information represented in cartographic form. The current dominance of spatial metaphors in information visualization research is the result of the realization that those cognitive skills also have value in the exploration and analysis of non-geographic information. While mapping or landscape metaphors are routinely used in this field, there is a noticeable lack of consideration for existing cartographic expertise. This is especially apparent whenever problematic issues are encountered, such as graphic complexity or feature labeling. There are a number of areas in which a cartographic outlook could provide a valuable perspective. This paper discusses how geographic and cartographic notions may influence the design of visualizations for textual information spaces. Map projections, generalization, feature labeling and map design issues are discussed</docText>

The increasing diversity of computers, especially among small mobile devices such as mobile phones and PDAs, raise new questions about information visualization techniques developed for the desktop computer. Using a series of examples ranging from applications for ordinary desktop displays to web-browsers and other applications for PDAs, we describe how a focus+context technique, Flip Zooming, is changed due to the situation it is used in. Based on these examples, we discuss how the use of focus and context in focus+context techniques change in order to fit new areas of use for information visualization</docText>

        <docText>GADGET/IV: a taxonomic approach to semi-automatic design of information visualization applications using modular visualization environment

Since novice users of visualization systems lack knowledge and expertise in data visualization, it is a tough task for them to generate efficient and effective visualizations that allow them to comprehend information that is embedded in the data. Therefore, systems supporting the users to design appropriate visualizations are of great importance. The GADGET (Goal-oriented Application Design Guidance for modular visualization EnvironmenTs) system, which has been developed by the authors (1997), interactively helps users to design scientific visualization applications by presenting appropriate MVE (Modular Visualization Environment) prototypes according to the specification of the visualization goals expressed mainly with the Wehrend matrix (S. Wehrend &amp; C. Lewis, 1990). This paper extends this approach in order to develop a system named GADGET/IV, which is intended to provide the users with an environment for semi-automatic design of information visualization (IV) applications. To this end, a novel goal-oriented taxonomy of IV techniques is presented. Also, an initial design of the system architecture and user assistance flow is described. The usefulness of the GADGET/IV system is illustrated with example problems of Web site access frequency analysis</docText>

        <docText>WireVis: Visualization of Categorical, Time-Varying Data From Financial Transactions

Large financial institutions such as Bank of America handle hundreds of thousands of wire transactions per day. Although most transactions are legitimate, these institutions have legal and financial obligations in discovering those that are suspicious. With the methods of fraudulent activities ever changing, searching on predefined patterns is often insufficient in detecting previously undiscovered methods. In this paper, we present a set of coordinated visualizations based on identifying specific keywords within the wire transactions. The different views used in our system depict relationships among keywords and accounts over time. Furthermore, we introduce a search-by-example technique which extracts accounts that show similar transaction patterns. In collaboration with the Anti-Money Laundering division at Bank of America, we demonstrate that using our tool, investigators are able to detect accounts and transactions that exhibit suspicious behaviors.</docText>

        <docText>A taxonomy of visualization techniques using the data state reference model

In previous work, researchers have attempted to construct taxonomies of information visualization techniques by examining the data domains that are compatible with these techniques. This is useful because implementers can quickly identify various techniques that can be applied to their domain of interest. However, these taxonomies do not help the implementers understand how to apply and implement these techniques. The author extends and proposes a new way to taxonomize information visualization techniques by using the Data State Model (E.H. Chi and J.T. Reidl, 1998). In fact, as the taxonomic analysis in the paper will show, many of the techniques share similar operating steps that can easily be reused. The paper shows that the Data State Model not only helps researchers understand the space of design, but also helps implementers understand how information visualization techniques can be applied more broadly</docText>

        <docText>Session Viewer: Visual Exploratory Analysis of Web Session Logs

Large-scale session log analysis typically includes statistical methods and detailed log examinations. While both methods have merits, statistical methods can miss previously unknown sub- populations in the data and detailed analyses may have selection biases. We therefore built Session Viewer, a visualization tool to facilitate and bridge between statistical and detailed analyses. Taking a multiple-coordinated view approach, Session Viewer shows multiple session populations at the Aggregate, Multiple, and Detail data levels to support different analysis styles. To bridge between the statistical and the detailed analysis levels, Session Viewer provides fluid traversal between data levels and side-by-side comparison at all data levels. We describe an analysis of a large-scale web usage study to demonstrate the use of Session Viewer, where we quantified the importance of grouping sessions based on task type.</docText>

        <docText>Focus+context display and navigation techniques for enhancing radial, space-filling hierarchy visualizations

Radial, space-filling visualizations can be useful for depicting information hierarchies, but they suffer from one major problem. As the hierarchy grows in size, many items become small, peripheral slices that are difficult to distinguish. We have developed three visualization/interaction techniques that provide flexible browsing of the display. The techniques allow viewers to examine the small items in detail while providing context within the entire information hierarchy. Additionally, smooth transitions between views help users maintain orientation within the complete information space</docText>

        <docText>SpiralView: Towards Security Policies Assessment through Visual Correlation of Network Resources with Evolution of Alarms

This article presents SpiralView, a visualization tool for helping system administrators to assess network policies. The tool is meant to be a complementary support to the routine activity of network monitoring, enabling a retrospective view on the alarms generated during and extended period of time. The tool permits to reason about how alarms distribute over time and how they correlate with network resources (e.g., users, IPs, applications, etc.), supporting the analysts in understanding how the network evolves and thus in devising new security policies for the future. The spiral visualization plots alarms in time, and, coupled with interactive bar charts and a users/applications graph view, is used to present network data and perform queries. The user is able to segment the data in meaningful subsets, zoom on specific related information, and inspect for relationships between alarms, users, and applications. In designing the visualizations and their interaction, and through tests with security experts, several ameliorations over the standard techniques have been provided.</docText>

        <docText>Density functions for visual attributes and effective partitioning in graph visualization

Two tasks in graph visualization require partitioning: the assignment of visual attributes and divisive clustering. Often, we would like to assign a color or other visual attributes to a node or edge that indicates an associated value. In an application involving divisive clustering, we would like to partition the graph into subsets of graph elements based on metric values in such a way that all subsets are evenly populated. Assuming a uniform distribution of metric values during either partitioning or coloring can have undesired effects such as empty clusters or only one level of emphasis for the entire graph. Probability density functions derived from statistics about a metric can help systems succeed at these tasks</docText>

Investigative analysts who work with collections of text documents connect embedded threads of evidence in order to formulate hypotheses about plans and activities of potential interest. As the number of documents and the corresponding number of concepts and entities within the documents grow larger, sense-making processes become more and more difficult for the analysts. We have developed a visual analytic system called Jigsaw that represents documents and their entities visually in order to help analysts examine reports more efficiently and develop theories about potential actions more quickly. Jigsaw provides multiple coordinated views of document entities with a special emphasis on visually illustrating connections between entities across the different documents.</docText>

        <docText>NewsLab: Exploratory Broadcast News Video Analysis

In this paper, we introduce NewsLab, an exploratory visualization approach for the analysis of large scale broadcast news video collections containing many thousands of news stories over extended periods of time. A river metaphor is used to depict the thematic changes of the news over time. An interactive lens metaphor allows the playback of fine-grained video segments selected through the river overview. Multi-resolution navigation is supported via a hierarchical time structure as well as a hierarchical theme structure. Themes can be explored hierarchically according to their thematic structure, or in an unstructured fashion using various ranking criteria. A rich set of interactions such as filtering, drill-down/roll-up navigation, history animation, and keyword based search are also provided. Our case studies show how this set of tools can be used to find emerging topics in the news, compare different broadcasters, or mine the news for topics of interest.</docText>

        <docText>Spatially Ordered Treemaps

Existing treemap layout algorithms suffer to some extent from poor or inconsistent mappings between data order and visual ordering in their representation, reducing their cognitive plausibility. While attempts have been made to quantify this mismatch, and algorithms proposed to minimize inconsistency, solutions provided tend to concentrate on one-dimensional ordering. We propose extensions to the existing squarified layout algorithm that exploit the two-dimensional arrangement of treemap nodes more effectively. Our proposed spatial squarified layout algorithm provides a more consistent arrangement of nodes while maintaining low aspect ratios. It is suitable for the arrangement of data with a geographic component and can be used to create tessellated cartograms for geovisualization. Locational consistency is measured and visualized and a number of layout algorithms are compared. CIELab color space and displacement vector overlays are used to assess and emphasize the spatial layout of treemap nodes. A case study involving locations of tagged photographs in the Flickr database is described.</docText>

        <docText>Literature Fingerprinting: A New Method for Visual Literary Analysis

In computer-based literary analysis different types of features are used to characterize a text. Usually, only a single feature value or vector is calculated for the whole text. In this paper, we combine automatic literature analysis methods with an effective visualization technique to analyze the behavior of the feature values across the text. For an interactive visual analysis, we calculate a sequence of feature values per text and present them to the user as a characteristic fingerprint. The feature values may be calculated on different hierarchy levels, allowing the analysis to be done on different resolution levels. A case study shows several successful applications of our new method to known literature problems and demonstrates the advantage of our new visual literature fingerprinting.</docText>

        <docText>Interactive Visual Analysis of Set-Typed Data

While it is quite typical to deal with attributes of different data types in the visualization of heterogeneous and multivariate datasets, most existing techniques still focus on the most usual data types such as numerical attributes or strings. In this paper we present a new approach to the interactive visual exploration and analysis of data that contains attributes which are of set type. A set-typed attribute of a data item - like one cell in a table - has a list of nGt=0 elements as its value. We present the setpsilaopsilagram as a new visualization approach to represent data of set type and to enable interactive visual exploration and analysis. We also demonstrate how this approach is capable to help in dealing with datasets that have a larger number of dimensions (more than a dozen or more), especially also in the context of categorical data. To illustrate the effectiveness of our approach, we present the interactive visual analysis of a CRM dataset with data from a questionnaire on the education and shopping habits of about 90000 people.</docText>

        <docText>Analyzing Large-Scale News Video Databases to Support Knowledge Visualization and Intuitive Retrieval

In this paper, we have developed a novel framework to enable more effective investigation of large-scale news video database via knowledge visualization. To relieve users from the burdensome exploration of well-known and uninteresting knowledge of news reports, a novel interestingness measurement for video news reports is presented to enable users to find news stories of interest at first glance and capture the relevant knowledge in large-scale video news databases efficiently. Our framework takes advantage of both automatic semantic video analysis and human intelligence by integrating with visualization techniques on semantic video retrieval systems. Our techniques on intelligent news video analysis and knowledge discovery have the capacity to enable more effective visualization and exploration of large-scale news video collections. In addition, news video visualization and exploration can provide valuable feedback to improve our techniques for intelligent news video analysis and knowledge discovery.</docText>

Many graph layout algorithms optimize visual characteristics to achieve useful representations. Implicitly, their goal is to create visual representations that are more intuitive to human observers. In this paper, we asked users to explicitly manipulate nodes in a network diagram to create layouts that they felt best captured the relationships in the data. This allowed us to measure organizational behavior directly, allowing us to evaluate the perceptual importance of particular visual features, such as edge crossings and edge-lengths uniformity. We also manipulated the interior structure of the node relationships by designing data sets that contained clusters, that is, sets of nodes that are strongly interconnected. By varying the degree to which these clusters were ldquomaskedrdquo by extraneous edges we were able to measure observerspsila sensitivity to the existence of clusters and how they revealed them in the network diagram. Based on these measurements we found that observers are able to recover cluster structure, that the distance between clusters is inversely related to the strength of the clustering, and that users exhibit the tendency to use edges to visually delineate perceptual groups. These results demonstrate the role of perceptual organization in representing graph data and provide concrete recommendations for graph layout algorithms.</docText>

        <docText>Point Placement by Phylogenetic Trees and its Application to Visual Analysis of Document Collections

The task of building effective representations to visualize and explore collections with moderate to large number of documents is hard. It depends on the evaluation of some distance measure among texts and also on the representation of such relationships in bi- dimensional spaces. In this paper we introduce an alternative approach for building visual maps of documents based on their content similarity, through reconstruction of phylogenetic trees. The tree is capable of representing relationships that allows the user to quickly recover information detected by the similarity metric. For a variety of text collections of different natures we show that we can achieve improved exploration capability and more clear visualization of relationships amongst documents.</docText>

        <docText>Effectiveness of Animation in Trend Visualization

Animation has been used to show trends in multi-dimensional data. This technique has recently gained new prominence for presentations, most notably with Gapminder Trendalyzer. In Trendalyzer, animation together with interesting data and an engaging presenter helps the audience understand the results of an analysis of the data. It is less clear whether trend animation is effective for analysis. This paper proposes two alternative trend visualizations that use static depictions of trends: one which shows traces of all trends overlaid simultaneously in one display and a second that uses a small multiples display to show the trend traces side-by-side. The paper evaluates the three visualizations for both analysis and presentation. Results indicate that trend animation can be challenging to use even for presentations; while it is the fastest technique for presentation and participants find it enjoyable and exciting, it does lead to many participant errors. Animation is the least effective form for analysis; both static depictions of trends are significantly faster than animation, and the small multiples display is more accurate.</docText>

        <docText>Intelligent Visual Analytics Queries

Visualizations of large multi-dimensional data sets, occurring in scientific and commercial applications, often reveal interesting local patterns. Analysts want to identify the causes and impacts of these interesting areas, and they also want to search for similar patterns occurring elsewhere in the data set. In this paper we introduce the Intelligent Visual Analytics Query (IVQuery) concept that combines visual interaction with automated analytical methods to support analysts in discovering the special properties and relations of identified patterns. The idea of IVQuery is to interactively select focus areas in the visualization. Then, according to the characteristics of the selected areas, such as the data dimensions and records, IVQuery employs analytical methods to identify the relationships to other portions of the data set. Finally, IVQuery generates visual representations for analysts to view and refine the results. IVQuery has been applied successfully to different real-world data sets, such as data warehouse performance, product sales, and sever performance analysis, and demonstrates the benefits of this technique over traditional filtering and zooming techniques. The visual analytics query technique can be used with many different types of visual representation. In this paper we show how to use IVQuery with parallel coordinates, visual maps, and scatter plots.</docText>

        <docText>Improving the Readability of Clustered Social Networks using Node Duplication

Exploring communities is an important task in social network analysis. Such communities are currently identified using clustering methods to group actors. This approach often leads to actors belonging to one and only one cluster, whereas in real life a person can belong to several communities. As a solution we propose duplicating actors in social networks and discuss potential impact of such a move. Several visual duplication designs are discussed and a controlled experiment comparing network visualization with and without duplication is performed, using 6 tasks that are important for graph readability and visual interpretation of social networks. We show that in our experiment, duplications significantly improve community-related tasks but sometimes interfere with other graph readability tasks. Finally, we propose a set of guidelines for deciding when to duplicate actors and choosing candidates for duplication, and alternative ways to render them in social network representations.</docText>

        <docText>Analysis Guided Visual Exploration of Multivariate Data

Visualization systems traditionally focus on graphical representation of information. They tend not to provide integrated analytical services that could aid users in tackling complex knowledge discovery tasks. Users' exploration in such environments is usually impeded due to several problems: 1) valuable information is hard to discover when too much data is visualized on the screen; 2) Users have to manage and organize their discoveries off line, because no systematic discovery management mechanism exists; 3) their discoveries based on visual exploration alone may lack accuracy; 4) and they have no convenient access to the important knowledge learned by other users. To tackle these problems, it has been recognized that analytical tools must be introduced into visualization systems. In this paper, we present a novel analysis-guided exploration system, called the nugget management system (NMS). It leverages the collaborative effort of human comprehensibility and machine computations to facilitate users' visual exploration processes. Specifically, NMS first extracts the valuable information (nuggets) hidden in datasets based on the interests of users. Given that similar nuggets may be re-discovered by different users, NMS consolidates the nugget candidate set by clustering based on their semantic similarity. To solve the problem of inaccurate discoveries, localized data mining techniques are applied to refine the nuggets to best represent the captured patterns in datasets. Lastly, the resulting well-organized nugget pool is used to guide users' exploration. To evaluate the effectiveness of NMS, we integrated NMS into Xmd- vTool, a freeware multivariate visualization system. User studies were performed to compare the users' efficiency and accuracy in finishing tasks on real datasets, with and without the help of NMS. Our user studies confirmed the effectiveness of NMS.</docText>

        <docText>Evaluating the Use of Data Transformation for Information Visualization

Data transformation, the process of preparing raw data for effective visualization, is one of the key challenges in information visualization. Although researchers have developed many data transformation techniques, there is little empirical study of the general impact of data transformation on visualization. Without such study, it is difficult to systematically decide when and which data transformation techniques are needed. We thus have designed and conducted a two-part empirical study that examines how the use of common data transformation techniques impacts visualization quality, which in turn affects user task performance. Our first experiment studies the impact of data transformation on user performance in single-step, typical visual analytic tasks. The second experiment assesses the impact of data transformation in multi-step analytic tasks. Our results quantify the benefits of data transformation in both experiments. More importantly, our analyses reveal that (1) the benefits of data transformation vary significantly by task and by visualization, and (2) the use of data transformation depends on a user's interaction context. Based on our findings, we present a set of design recommendations that help guide the development and use of data transformation techniques.</docText>

        <docText>Rapid Graph Layout Using Space Filling Curves

Network data frequently arises in a wide variety of fields, and node-link diagrams are a very natural and intuitive representation of such data. In order for a node-link diagram to be effective, the nodes must be arranged well on the screen. While many graph layout algorithms exist for this purpose, they often have limitations such as high computational complexity or node colocation. This paper proposes a new approach to graph layout through the use of space filling curves which is very fast and guarantees that there will be no nodes that are colocated. The resulting layout is also aesthetic and satisfies several criteria for graph layout effectiveness.</docText>

        <docText>Exploration of Networks using overview+detail with Constraint-based cooperative layout

A standard approach to large network visualization is to provide an overview of the network and a detailed view of a small component of the graph centred around a focal node. The user explores the network by changing the focal node in the detailed view or by changing the level of detail of a node or cluster. For scalability, fast force-based layout algorithms are used for the overview and the detailed view. However, using the same layout algorithm in both views is problematic since layout for the detailed view has different requirements to that in the overview. Here we present a model in which constrained graph layout algorithms are used for layout in the detailed view. This means the detailed view has high-quality layout including sophisticated edge routing and is customisable by the user who can add placement constraints on the layout. Scalability is still ensured since the slower layout techniques are only applied to the small subgraph shown in the detailed view. The main technical innovations are techniques to ensure that the overview and detailed view remain synchronized, and modifying constrained graph layout algorithms to support smooth, stable layout. The key innovation supporting stability are new dynamic graph layout algorithms that preserve the topology or structure of the network when the user changes the focus node or the level of detail by in situ semantic zooming. We have built a prototype tool and demonstrate its use in two application domains, UML class diagrams and biological networks.</docText>

        <docText>On the Visualization of Social and other Scale-Free Networks

This paper proposes novel methods for visualizing specifically the large power-law graphs that arise in sociology and the sciences. In such cases a large portion of edges can be shown to be less important and removed while preserving component connectedness and other features (e.g. cliques) to more clearly reveal the networkpsilas underlying connection pathways. This simplification approach deterministically filters (instead of clustering) the graph to retain important node and edge semantics, and works both automatically and interactively. The improved graph filtering and layout is combined with a novel computer graphics anisotropic shading of the dense crisscrossing array of edges to yield a full social network and scale-free graph visualization system. Both quantitative analysis and visual results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach.</docText>

        <docText>Geometry-Based Edge Clustering for Graph Visualization

Graphs have been widely used to model relationships among data. For large graphs, excessive edge crossings make the display visually cluttered and thus difficult to explore. In this paper, we propose a novel geometry-based edge-clustering framework that can group edges into bundles to reduce the overall edge crossings. Our method uses a control mesh to guide the edge-clustering process; edge bundles can be formed by forcing all edges to pass through some control points on the mesh. The control mesh can be generated at different levels of detail either manually or automatically based on underlying graph patterns. Users can further interact with the edge-clustering results through several advanced visualization techniques such as color and opacity enhancement. Compared with other edge-clustering methods, our approach is intuitive, flexible, and efficient. The experiments on some large graphs demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.</docText>

In particular, we formally describe the calculations needed to extend such algorithms to hyperbolic and spherical geometries</docText>

        <docText>Visualizing massive multi-digraphs

We describe MGV, an integrated visualization and exploration system for massive multi-digraph navigation. MGV's only assumption is that the vertex set of the underlying digraph corresponds to the set of leaves of a predetermined tree T. MGV builds an out-of-core graph hierarchy and provides mechanisms to plug in arbitrary visual representations for each graph hierarchy slice. Navigation from one level to another of the hierarchy corresponds to the implementation of a drill-down interface. In order to provide the user with navigation control and interactive response, MGV incorporates a number of visualization techniques like interactive pixel-oriented 2D and 3D maps, statistical displays, multi-linked views, and a zoomable label based interface. This makes the association of geographic information and graph data very natural. MGV follows the client-server paradigm and it is implemented in C and Java-3D. We highlight the main algorithmic and visualization techniques behind the tools and point out along the way several possible application scenarios. Our techniques are being applied to multi-graphs defined on vertex sets with sizes ranging from 100 million to 250 million vertices</docText>

The paper describes major concepts of a scalable information visualization framework. We assume that the exploration of heterogeneous information spaces at arbitrary levels of detail requires a suitable preprocessing of information quantities, the combination of different graphical interfaces and the illustration of the frame of reference of given information sets. The innovative features of our system include: dynamic hierarchy computation and user controlled refinement of those hierarchies for preprocessing unstructured information spaces; a new Focus+Context technique for visualizing complex hierarchy graphs; a new paradigm for visualizing information structures within their frame of reference; and a new graphical interface that utilizes textual similarities to arrange objects of high dimensional information space in 3-dimensional visualization space</docText>

        <docText>Getting portals to behave

Data visualization environments help users understand and analyze their data by permitting interactive browsing of graphical representations of the data. To further facilitate understanding and analysis, many visualization environments have special features known as portals, which are sub-windows of a data canvas. Portals provide a way to display multiple graphical representations simultaneously, in a nested fashion. This makes portals an extremely powerful and flexible paradigm for data visualization. Unfortunately, with this flexibility comes complexity. There are over a hundred possible ways each portal can be configured to exhibit different behaviors. Many of these behaviors are confusing and certain behaviors can be inappropriate for a particular setting. It is desirable to eliminate confusing and inappropriate behaviors. The authors construct a taxonomy of portal behaviors and give recommendations to help designers of visualization systems decide which behaviors are intuitive and appropriate for a particular setting. They apply these recommendations to an example setting that is fully visually programmable and analyze the resulting reduced set of behaviors. Finally, the authors consider a real visualization environment and demonstrate some problems associated with behaviors that do not follow their recommendations</docText>

        <docText>Polaris: a system for query, analysis and visualization of multi-dimensional relational databases

In the last several years, large multi-dimensional databases have become common in a variety of applications such as data warehousing and scientific computing. Analysis and exploration tasks place significant demands on the interfaces to these databases. Because of the size of the data sets, dense graphical representations are more effective for exploration than spreadsheets and charts. Furthermore, because of the exploratory nature of the analysis, it must be possible for the analysts to change visualizations rapidly as they pursue a cycle involving first hypothesis and then experimentation. The authors present Polaris, an interface for exploring large multi-dimensional databases that extends the well-known Pivot Table interface. The novel features of Polaris include an interface for constructing visual specifications of table based graphical displays and the ability to generate a precise set of relational queries from the visual specifications. The visual specifications can be rapidly and incrementally developed, giving the analyst visual feedback as they construct complex queries and visualizations</docText>

        <docText>Viz-A-Vis: Toward Visualizing Video through Computer Vision

In the established procedural model of information visualization, the first operation is to transform raw data into data tables. The transforms typically include abstractions that aggregate and segment relevant data and are usually defined by a human, user or programmer. The theme of this paper is that for video, data transforms should be supported by low level computer vision. High level reasoning still resides in the human analyst, while part of the low level perception is handled by the computer. To illustrate this approach, we present Viz-A-Vis, an overhead video capture and access system for activity analysis in natural settings over variable periods of time. Overhead video provides rich opportunities for long-term behavioral and occupancy analysis, but it poses considerable challenges. We present initial steps addressing two challenges. First, overhead video generates overwhelmingly large volumes of video impractical to analyze manually. Second, automatic video analysis remains an open problem for computer vision.</docText>

        <docText>The Shaping of Information by Visual Metaphors

The nature of an information visualization can be considered to lie in the visual metaphors it uses to structure information. The process of understanding a visualization therefore involves an interaction between these external visual metaphors and the user's internal knowledge representations. To investigate this claim, we conducted an experiment to test the effects of visual metaphor and verbal metaphor on the understanding of tree visualizations. Participants answered simple data comprehension questions while viewing either a treemap or a node-link diagram. Questions were worded to reflect a verbal metaphor that was either compatible or incompatible with the visualization a participant was using. The results suggest that the visual metaphor indeed affects how a user derives information from a visualization. Additionally, we found that the degree to which a user is affected by the metaphor is strongly correlated with the user's ability to answer task questions correctly. These findings are a first step towards illuminating how visual metaphors shape user understanding, and have significant implications for the evaluation, application, and theory of visualization.</docText>

        <docText>Cerebral: Visualizing Multiple Experimental Conditions on a Graph with Biological Context

Systems biologists use interaction graphs to model the behavior of biological systems at the molecular level. In an iterative process, such biologists observe the reactions of living cells under various experimental conditions, view the results in the context of the interaction graph, and then propose changes to the graph model. These graphs serve as a form of dynamic knowledge representation of the biological system being studied and evolve as new insight is gained from the experimental data. While numerous graph layout and drawing packages are available, these tools did not fully meet the needs of our immunologist collaborators. In this paper, we describe the data information display needs of these immunologists and translate them into design decisions. These decisions led us to create Cerebral, a system that uses a biologically guided graph layout and incorporates experimental data directly into the graph display. Small multiple views of different experimental conditions and a data-driven parallel coordinates view enable correlations between experimental conditions to be analyzed at the same time that the data is viewed in the graph context. This combination of coordinated views allows the biologist to view the data from many different perspectives simultaneously. To illustrate the typical analysis tasks performed, we analyze two datasets using Cerebral. Based on feedback from our collaborators we conclude that Cerebral is a valuable tool for analyzing experimental data in the context of an interaction graph model.</docText>

        <docText>Stacked Graphs ? Geometry &amp; Aesthetics

In February 2008, the New York Times published an unusual chart of box office revenues for 7500 movies over 21 years. The chart was based on a similar visualization, developed by the first author, that displayed trends in music listening. This paper describes the design decisions and algorithms behind these graphics, and discusses the reaction on the Web. We suggest that this type of complex layered graph is effective for displaying large data sets to a mass audience. We provide a mathematical analysis of how this layered graph relates to traditional stacked graphs and to techniques such as ThemeRiver, showing how each method is optimizing a different ldquoenergy functionrdquo. Finally, we discuss techniques for coloring and ordering the layers of such graphs. Throughout the paper, we emphasize the interplay between considerations of aesthetics and legibility.</docText>

        <docText>Particle-based labeling: Fast point-feature labeling without obscuring other visual features

In many information visualization techniques, labels are an essential part to communicate the visualized data. To preserve the expressiveness of the visual representation, a placed label should neither occlude other labels nor visual representatives (e.g., icons, lines) that communicate crucial information. Optimal, non-overlapping labeling is an NP-hard problem. Thus, only a few approaches achieve a fast non-overlapping labeling in highly interactive scenarios like information visualization. These approaches generally target the point-feature label placement (PFLP) problem, solving only label-label conflicts. This paper presents a new, fast, solid and flexible 2D labeling approach for the PFLP problem that additionally respects other visual elements and the visual extent of labeled features. The results (number of placed labels, processing time) of our particle-based method compare favorably to those of existing techniques. Although the esthetic quality of non-real-time approaches may not be achieved with our method, it complies with practical demands and thus supports the interactive exploration of information spaces. In contrast to the known adjacent techniques, the flexibility of our technique enables labeling of dense point clouds by the use of non-occluding distant labels. Our approach is independent of the underlying visualization technique, which enables us to demonstrate the application of our labeling method within different information visualization scenarios.</docText>

        <docText>HiPP: A Novel Hierarchical Point Placement Strategy and its Application to the Exploration of Document Collections

Point placement strategies aim at mapping data points represented in higher dimensions to bi-dimensional spaces and are frequently used to visualize relationships amongst data instances. They have been valuable tools for analysis and exploration of data sets of various kinds. Many conventional techniques, however, do not behave well when the number of dimensions is high, such as in the case of documents collections. Later approaches handle that shortcoming, but may cause too much clutter to allow flexible exploration to take place. In this work we present a novel hierarchical point placement technique that is capable of dealing with these problems. While good grouping and separation of data with high similarity is maintained without increasing computation cost, its hierarchical structure lends itself both to exploration in various levels of detail and to handling data in subsets, improving analysis capability and also allowing manipulation of larger data sets.</docText>

        <docText>The Word Tree, an Interactive Visual Concordance

We introduce the Word Tree, a new visualization and information-retrieval technique aimed at text documents. A Word Tree is a graphical version of the traditional "keyword-in-context" method, and enables rapid querying and exploration of bodies of text. In this paper we describe the design of the technique, along with some of the technical issues that arise in its implementation. In addition, we discuss the results of several months of public deployment of word trees on Many Eyes, which provides a window onto the ways in which users obtain value from the visualization.</docText>

        <docText>Interactive Visualization of Small World Graphs

Many real world graphs have small world characteristics, that is, they have a small diameter compared to the number of nodes and exhibit a local cluster structure. Examples are social networks, software structures, bibliographic references and biological neural nets. Their high connectivity makes both finding a pleasing layout and a suitable clustering hard. In this paper we present a method to create scalable, interactive visualizations of small world graphs, allowing the user to inspect local clusters while maintaining a global overview of the entire structure. The visualization method uses a combination of both semantical and geometrical distortions, while the layout is generated by a spring embedder algorithm using recently developed force model. We use a cross referenced database of 500 artists as a running example</docText>

        <docText>Vispedia: Interactive Visual Exploration of Wikipedia Data via Search-Based Integration

Wikipedia is an example of the collaborative, semi-structured data sets emerging on the Web. These data sets have large, non-uniform schema that require costly data integration into structured tables before visualization can begin. We present Vispedia, a Web-based visualization system that reduces the cost of this data integration. Users can browse Wikipedia, select an interesting data table, then use a search interface to discover, integrate, and visualize additional columns of data drawn from multiple Wikipedia articles. This interaction is supported by a fast path search algorithm over DBpedia, a semantic graph extracted from Wikipedia's hyperlink structure. Vispedia can also export the augmented data tables produced for use in traditional visualization systems. We believe that these techniques begin to address the "long tail" of visualization by allowing a wider audience to visualize a broader class of data. We evaluated this system in a first-use formative lab study. Study participants were able to quickly create effective visualizations for a diverse set of domains, performing data integration as needed.</docText>

        <docText>Dynamic Drawing of Clustered Graphs

This paper presents an algorithm for drawing a sequence of graphs that contain an inherent grouping of their vertex set into clusters. It differs from previous work on dynamic graph drawing in the emphasis that is put on maintaining the clustered structure of the graph during incremental layout. The algorithm works online and allows arbitrary modifications to the graph. It is generic and can be implemented using a wide range of static force-directed graph layout tools. The paper introduces several metrics for measuring layout quality of dynamic clustered graphs. The performance of our algorithm is analyzed using these metrics. The algorithm has been successfully applied to visualizing mobile object software</docText>

        <docText>VisGets: Coordinated Visualizations for Web-based Information Exploration and Discovery

In common Web-based search interfaces, it can be difficult to formulate queries that simultaneously combine temporal, spatial, and topical data filters. We investigate how coordinated visualizations can enhance search and exploration of information on the World Wide Web by easing the formulation of these types of queries. Drawing from visual information seeking and exploratory search, we introduce VisGets - interactive query visualizations of Web-based information that operate with online information within a Web browser. VisGets provide the information seeker with visual overviews of Web resources and offer a way to visually filter the data. Our goal is to facilitate the construction of dynamic search queries that combine filters from more than one data dimension. We present a prototype information exploration system featuring three linked VisGets (temporal, spatial, and topical), and used it to visually explore news items from online RSS feeds.</docText>

        <docText>Matrix Zoom: A Visual Interface to Semi-External Graphs

In Web data, telecommunications traffic and in epidemiological studies, dense subgraphs correspond to subsets of subjects (i.e. users, patients) that share a collection of attributes values (i.e. accessed Web pages, email-calling patterns or disease diagnostic profiles). Visual and computational identification of these "clusters" becomes useful when domain experts desire to determine those factors of major influence in the formation of access and communication clusters or in the detection and contention of disease spread. With the current increases in graphic hardware capabilities and RAM sizes, it is more useful to relate graph sizes to the available screen real estate S and the amount of available RAM M, instead of the number of edges or nodes in the graph. We offer a visual interface that is parameterized by M and S and is particularly suited for navigation tasks that require the identification of subgraphs whose edge density is above certain threshold. This is achieved by providing a zoomable matrix view of the underlying data. This view is strongly coupled to a hierarchical view of the essential information elements present in the data domain. We illustrate the applicability of this work to the visual navigation of cancer incidence data and to an aggregated sample of phone call traffic</docText>

        <docText>Who Votes For What? A Visual Query Language for Opinion Data

Surveys and opinion polls are extremely popular in the media, especially in the months preceding a general election. However, the available tools for analyzing poll results often require specialized training. Hence, data analysis remains out of reach for many casual computer users. Moreover, the visualizations used to communicate the results of surveys are typically limited to traditional statistical graphics like bar graphs and pie charts, both of which are fundamentally noninteractive. We present a simple interactive visualization that allows users to construct queries on large tabular data sets, and view the results in real time. The results of two separate user studies suggest that our interface lowers the learning curve for naive users, while still providing enough analytical power to discover interesting correlations in the data.</docText>

        <docText>Topological Fisheye Views for Visualizing Large Graphs

Graph drawing is a basic visualization tool. For graphs of up to hundreds of nodes and edges, there are many effective techniques available. At greater scale, data density and occlusion problems often negate its effectiveness. Conventional pan-and-zoom, and multiscale and geometric fisheye views are not fully satisfactory solutions to this problem. As an alternative, we describe a topological zooming method. It is based on the precomputation of a hierarchy of coarsened graphs, which are combined on the fly into renderings with the level of detail dependent on the distance from one or more foci. We also discuss a related distortion method that allows our technique to achieve constant information density displays</docText>

        <docText>The InfoVis Toolkit

This article presents the InfoVis toolkit, designed to support the creation, extension and integration of advanced 2D information visualization components into interactive Java swing applications. The InfoVis toolkit provides specific data structures to achieve a fast action/feedback loop required by dynamic queries. It comes with a large set of components such as range sliders and tailored control panels required to control and configure the visualizations. These components are integrated into a coherent framework that simplifies the management of rich data structures and the design and extension of visualizations. Supported data structures currently include tables, trees and graphs. Supported visualizations include scatter plots, time series, parallel coordinates, treemaps, icicle trees, node-link diagrams for trees and graphs and adjacency matrices for graphs. All visualizations can use fisheye lenses and dynamic labeling. The InfoVis toolkit supports hardware acceleration when available through Agile2D, an implementation of the Java graphics API based on OpenGL, achieving speedups of 10 to 200 times. The article also shows how new visualizations can be added and extended to become components, enriching visualizations as well as general applications</docText>

        <docText>Building Highly-Coordinated Visualizations in Improvise

Improvise is a fully-implemented system in which users build and browse multiview visualizations interactively using a simple shared-object coordination mechanism coupled with a flexible, expression-based visual abstraction language. By coupling visual abstraction with coordination, users gain precise control over how navigation and selection in the visualization affects the appearance of data in individual views. As a result, it is practical to build visualizations with more views and richer coordination in Improvise than in other visualization systems. Building and browsing activities are integrated in a single, live user interface that lets users alter visualizations quickly and incrementally during data exploration</docText>

        <docText>Rethinking Visualization: A High-Level Taxonomy

We present the novel high-level visualization taxonomy. Our taxonomy classifies visualization algorithms rather than data. Algorithms are categorized based on the assumptions they make about the data being visualized; we call this set of assumptions the design model. Because our taxonomy is based on design models, it is more flexible than existing taxonomies and considers the user's conceptual model, emphasizing the human aspect of visualization. Design models are classified according to whether they are discrete or continuous and by how much the algorithm designer chooses display attributes such as spatialization, timing, colour, and transparency. This novel approach provides an alternative view of the visualization field that helps explain how traditional divisions (e.g., information and scientific visualization) relates and overlap, and that may inspire research ideas in hybrid visualization areas</docText>

        <docText>BEST PAPER: A Knowledge Task-Based Framework for Design and Evaluation of Information Visualizations

The design and evaluation of most current information visualization systems descend from an emphasis on a user's ability to "unpack" the representations of data of interest and operate on them independently. Too often, successful decision-making and analysis are more a matter of serendipity and user experience than of intentional design and specific support for such tasks; although humans have considerable abilities in analyzing relationships from data, the utility of visualizations remains relatively variable across users, data sets, and domains. In this paper, we discuss the notion of analytic gaps, which represent obstacles faced by visualizations in facilitating higher-level analytic tasks, such as decision-making and learning. We discuss support for bridging the analytic gap, propose a framework for design and evaluation of information visualization systems, and demonstrate its use</docText>

We describe an exploratory technique based on the direct interaction with a 2D modified scatterplot computed from two different metrics calculated over the elements of a network. The scatterplot is transformed into an image by applying standard image processing techniques resulting into blurring effects. Segmentation of the image allow to easily select patches on the image as a way to extract subnetworks. We were inspired by the work of Wattenberg and Fisher [M. Wattenberg et al. (2003)] showing that the blurring process builds into a multiscale perceptual scheme, making this type of interaction intuitive to the user. We explain how the exploration of the network can be guided by the visual analysis of the blurred scatterplot and by its possible interpretations</docText>

        <docText>Evaluating a System for Interactive Exploration of Large, Hierarchically Structured Document Repositories

The InfoSky visual explorer is a system enabling users to interactively explore large, hierarchically structured document collections. Similar to a real-world telescope, InfoSky employs a planar graphical representation with variable magnification. Documents of similar content are placed close to each other and displayed as stars, while collections of documents at a particular level in the hierarchy are visualised as bounding polygons. Usability testing of an early prototype implementation of InfoSky revealed several design issues which prevented users from fully exploiting the power of the visual metaphor. Evaluation results have been incorporated into an advanced prototype, and another usability test has been conducted. A comparison of test results demonstrates enhanced system performance and points out promising directions for further work</docText>

        <docText>Graphical Histories for Visualization: Supporting Analysis, Communication, and Evaluation

Interactive history tools, ranging from basic undo and redo to branching timelines of user actions, facilitate iterative forms of interaction. In this paper, we investigate the design of history mechanisms for information visualization. We present a design space analysis of both architectural and interface issues, identifying design decisions and associated trade-offs. Based on this analysis, we contribute a design study of graphical history tools for Tableau, a database visualization system. These tools record and visualize interaction histories, support data analysis and communication of findings, and contribute novel mechanisms for presenting, managing, and exporting histories. Furthermore, we have analyzed aggregated collections of history sessions to evaluate Tableau usage. We describe additional tools for analyzing userspsila history logs and how they have been applied to study usage patterns in Tableau.</docText>

        <docText>EMDialog: Bringing Information Visualization into the Museum

Digital information displays are becoming more common in public spaces such as museums, galleries, and libraries. However, the public nature of these locations requires special considerations concerning the design of information visualization in terms of visual representations and interaction techniques. We discuss the potential for, and challenges of, information visualization in the museum context based on our practical experience with EMDialog, an interactive information presentation that was part of the Emily Carr exhibition at the Glenbow Museum in Calgary. EMDialog visualizes the diverse and multi-faceted discourse about this Canadian artist with the goal to both inform and provoke discussion. It provides a visual exploration environment that offers interplay between two integrated visualizations, one for information access along temporal, and the other along contextual dimensions. We describe the results of an observational study we conducted at the museum that revealed the different ways visitors approached and interacted with EMDialog, as well as how they perceived this form of information presentation in the museum context. Our results include the need to present information in a manner sufficiently attractive to draw attention and the importance of rewarding passive observation as well as both short- and longer term information exploration.</docText>

        <docText>Distributed Cognition as a Theoretical Framework for Information Visualization

Even though information visualization (InfoVis) research has matured in recent years, it is generally acknowledged that the field still lacks supporting, encompassing theories. In this paper, we argue that the distributed cognition framework can be used to substantiate the theoretical foundation of InfoVis. We highlight fundamental assumptions and theoretical constructs of the distributed cognition approach, based on the cognitive science literature and a real life scenario. We then discuss how the distributed cognition framework can have an impact on the research directions and methodologies we take as InfoVis researchers. Our contributions are as follows. First, we highlight the view that cognition is more an emergent property of interaction than a property of the human mind. Second, we argue that a reductionist approach to study the abstract properties of isolated human minds may not be useful in informing InfoVis design. Finally we propose to make cognition an explicit research agenda, and discuss the implications on how we perform evaluation and theory building.</docText>

        <docText>Multi-Focused Geospatial Analysis Using Probes

Traditional geospatial information visualizations often present views that restrict the user to a single perspective. When zoomed out, local trends and anomalies become suppressed and lost; when zoomed in for local inspection, spatial awareness and comparison between regions become limited. In our model, coordinated visualizations are integrated within individual probe interfaces, which depict the local data in user-defined regions-of-interest. Our probe concept can be incorporated into a variety of geospatial visualizations to empower users with the ability to observe, coordinate, and compare data across multiple local regions. It is especially useful when dealing with complex simulations or analyses where behavior in various localities differs from other localities and from the system as a whole. We illustrate the effectiveness of our technique over traditional interfaces by incorporating it within three existing geospatial visualization systems: an agent-based social simulation, a census data exploration tool, and an 3D GIS environment for analyzing urban change over time. In each case, the probe-based interaction enhances spatial awareness, improves inspection and comparison capabilities, expands the range of scopes, and facilitates collaboration among multiple users.</docText>

        <docText>Balloon Focus: a Seamless Multi-Focus+Context Method for Treemaps

The treemap is one of the most popular methods for visualizing hierarchical data. When a treemap contains a large number of items, inspecting or comparing a few selected items in a greater level of detail becomes very challenging. In this paper, we present a seamless multi-focus and context technique, called Balloon Focus, that allows the user to smoothly enlarge multiple treemap items served as the foci, while maintaining a stable treemap layout as the context. Our method has several desirable features. First, this method is quite general and can be used with different treemap layout algorithms. Second, as the foci are enlarged, the relative positions among all items are preserved. Third, the foci are placed in a way that the remaining space is evenly distributed back to the non-focus treemap items. When Balloon Focus enlarges the focus items to a maximum degree, the above features ensure that the treemap will maintain a consistent appearance and avoid any abrupt layout changes. In our algorithm, a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) is used to maintain the positional constraints, and an elastic model is employed to govern the placement of the treemap items. We demonstrate a treemap visualization system that integrates data query, manual focus selection, and our novel multi-focus+context technique, Balloon Focus, together. A user study was conducted. Results show that with Balloon Focus, users can better perform the tasks of comparing the values and the distribution of the foci.</docText>

        <docText>A Framework of Interaction Costs in Information Visualization

Interaction cost is an important but poorly understood factor in visualization design. We propose a framework of interaction costs inspired by Normanpsilas Seven Stages of Action to facilitate study. From 484 papers, we collected 61 interaction-related usability problems reported in 32 user studies and placed them into our framework of seven costs: (1) Decision costs to form goals; (2) system-power costs to form system operations; (3) Multiple input mode costs to form physical sequences; (4) Physical-motion costs to execute sequences; (5) Visual-cluttering costs to perceive state; (6) View-change costs to interpret perception; (7) State-change costs to evaluate interpretation. We also suggested ways to narrow the gulfs of execution (2-4) and evaluation (5-7) based on collected reports. Our framework suggests a need to consider decision costs (1) as the gulf of goal formation.</docText>

        <docText>Rolling the Dice: Multidimensional Visual Exploration using Scatterplot Matrix Navigation

Scatterplots remain one of the most popular and widely-used visual representations for multidimensional data due to their simplicity, familiarity and visual clarity, even if they lack some of the flexibility and visual expressiveness of newer multidimensional visualization techniques. This paper presents new interactive methods to explore multidimensional data using scatterplots. This exploration is performed using a matrix of scatterplots that gives an overview of the possible configurations, thumbnails of the scatterplots, and support for interactive navigation in the multidimensional space. Transitions between scatterplots are performed as animated rotations in 3D space, somewhat akin to rolling dice. Users can iteratively build queries using bounding volumes in the dataset, sculpting the query from different viewpoints to become more and more refined. Furthermore, the dimensions in the navigation space can be reordered, manually or automatically, to highlight salient correlations and differences among them. An example scenario presents the interaction techniques supporting smooth and effortless visual exploration of multidimensional datasets.</docText>

Drawing on ethnographic studies of (landscape) architects at work, this paper presents a human-centered approach to information visualization. A 3D collaborative electronic workspace allows people to configure, save and browse arrangements of heterogeneous work materials. Spatial arrangements and links are created and maintained as an integral part of ongoing work with `live' documents and objects. The result is an extension of the physical information space of the architects' studio that utilizes the potential of electronic data storage, visualization and network technologies to support work with information in context </docText>

        <docText>Metaphor-aware 3D navigation

Anyone who has ever experienced three-dimensional (3D) interfaces will agree that navigating in a 3D world is not a trivial task. The user interface of traditional 3D browsers provides simple navigation tools that allow the user to modify the camera parameters such as orientation, position and focal. Using these tools, it is frequent that, after some movements, the user is lost in the virtual 3D space and usually tries to restart from the beginning. We present how the 3D navigation problem is addressed in the context of the CyberNet project (Abel et al., 2000). Our underlying principle is to help the user navigate by adapting the navigation tool to the virtual world. We feel that the navigation schemes provided by the 3D browsers are too generic for some specific 3D tools and we have developed adaptive navigation features that are dependent on the 3D metaphor used for visualizing the information and on the user's task</docText>

        <docText>Interactive problem solving via algorithm visualization

COMIND is a tool for conceptual design of industrial products. It helps designers define and evaluate the initial design space by using search algorithms to generate sets of feasible solutions. Two algorithm visualization techniques, Kaleidoscope and Lattice, and one visualization of n-dimensional data, MAP, are used to externalize the machine's problem solving strategies and the tradeoffs as a result of using these strategies. After a short training period, users are able to discover tactics to explore design space effectively, evaluate new design solutions, and learn important relationships among design criteria, search speed and solution quality. We thus propose that visualization can serve as a tool for interactive intelligence, ie., human-machine collaboration for solving complex problems</docText>

We describe a prototype same-time/different-place collaborative geovisualization environment. We outline an approach to understanding use and usability and present results of interviews with domain experts about the ways in which collaborative visualization might enable groups to work at a distance. One goal for our research is to design an effective and flexible system that can support group work on environmental science research mediated through dynamic geovisualization displays. We are addressing this goal using a four-step human-centered system design process, modeled on that proposed by (Gabbard et al., 1999) for development and evaluation of virtual environments. The steps they delineate are: user task analysis; expert guideline-based evaluation; formative user-centered evaluation; and summative comparative evaluation</docText>

        <docText>New methods for the visualization of electric power system information

One area in need of new research in information visualization is the operation and analysis of large-scale electric power systems. In analyzing power systems, one is usually confronted with a large amount of multivariate data. With systems containing tens of thousands of electrical nodes (buses), a key challenge is to present this data in a form so the user can assess the state of the system in an intuitive and quick manner. This is particularly true when trying to analyze relationships between actual network power flows, the scheduled power flows, and the capacity of the transmission system. With electric industry restructuring and the move towards having a single entity, such as an independent system operator or pool, operate a much larger system, this need has become more acute. This paper presents several power system visualization techniques to help in this task. These techniques include animation of power system flow values, contouring of bus and transmission line flow values, data aggregation techniques and interactive 3D data visualization</docText>

        <docText>Using multilevel call matrices in large software projects

Traditionally, node link diagrams are the prime choice when it comes to visualizing software architectures. However, node link diagrams often fall short when used to visualize large graph structures. In this paper we investigate the use of call matrices as visual aids in the management of large software projects. We argue that call matrices have a number of advantages over traditional node link diagrams when the main object of interest is the link instead of the node. Matrix visualizations can provide stable and crisp layouts of large graphs and are inherently well suited for large multilevel visualizations because of their recursive structure. We discuss a number of visualization issues, using a very large software project currently under development at Philips Medical Systems as a running example.</docText>

This paper proposes a conceptual model called compound brushing for modeling the brushing techniques used in dynamic data visualization. In this approach, brushing techniques are modeled as higraphs with five types of basic entities: data, selection, device, renderer, and transformation. Using this model, a flexible visual programming tool is designed not only to configure/control various common types of brushing techniques currently used in dynamic data visualization, but also to investigate new brushing techniques.</docText>

        <docText>A virtual workspace for hybrid multidimensional scaling algorithms

In visualising multidimensional data, it is well known that different types of algorithms to process them. Data sets might be distinguished according to volume, variable types and distribution, and each of these characteristics imposes constraints upon the choice of applicable algorithms for their visualization. Previous work has shown that a hybrid algorithmic approach can be successful in addressing the impact of data volume on the feasibility of multidimensional scaling (MDS). This suggests that hybrid combinations of appropriate algorithms might also successfully address other characteristics of data. This paper presents a system and framework in which a user can easily explore hybrid algorithms and the data flowing through them. Visual programming and a novel algorithmic architecture let the user semi-automatically define data flows and the co-ordination of multiple views.</docText>

    <docText>Smooth and efficient zooming and panning

Large 2D information spaces, such as maps, images, or abstract
visualizations, require views at various level of detail: close ups to
inspect details, overviews to maintain (literally) an overview. Users
often switch between these views. We discuss how smooth animations from
one view to another can be defined. To this end, a metric on the effect
of simultaneous zooming and panning is defined, based on an estimate of
the perceived velocity. Optimal is defined as smooth and efficient.
Given the metric, these terms can be translated into a computational
model, which is used to calculate an analytic solution for optimal
animations. The model has two free parameters: animation speed and
zoom/pan trade off. A user experiment to find good values for these is
described.</docText>

        <docText>A model of multi-scale perceptual organization in information
graphics

We propose a new method for assessing the perceptual
organization of information graphics, based on the premise that the
visual structure of an image should match the structure of the data it
is intended to convey. The core of our method is a new formal model of
one type of perceptual structure, based on classical machine vision
techniques for analyzing an image at multiple resolutions. The model
takes as input an arbitrary grayscale image and returns a lattice
structure describing the visual organization of the image. We show how
this model captures several aspects of traditional design aesthetics,
and we describe a software tool that implements the model to help
designers analyze and refine visual displays. Our emphasis here is on
demonstrating the model's potential as a design aid rather than as a
description of human perception, but given its initial promise we
propose a variety of ways in which the model could be extended and
validated.</docText>

        <docText>Exploring high-D spaces with multiform matrices and small
multiples

We introduce an approach to visual analysis of multivariate
data that integrates several methods from information visualization,
exploratory data analysis (EDA), and geovisualization. The approach
leverages the component-based architecture implemented in GeoVISTA
Studio to construct a flexible, multiview, tightly (but generically)
coordinated, EDA toolkit. This toolkit builds upon traditional ideas
behind both small multiples and scatterplot matrices in three
fundamental ways. First, we develop a general, multiform, bivariate
matrix and a complementary multiform, bivariate small multiple plot in
which different bivariate representation forms can be used in
combination. We demonstrate the flexibility of this approach with
matrices and small multiples that depict multivariate data through
combinations of: scatterplots, bivariate maps, and space-filling
displays. Second, we apply a measure of conditional entropy to (a)
identify variables from a high-dimensional data set that are likely to
display interesting relationships and (b) generate a default order of
these variables in the matrix or small multiple display. Third, we add
conditioning, a kind of dynamic query/filtering in which supplementary
(undisplayed) variables are used to constrain the view onto variables
that are displayed. Conditioning allows the effects of one or more well
understood variables to be removed form the analysis, making
relationships among remaining variables easier to explore. We illustrate
the individual and combined functionality enabled by this approach
through application to analysis of cancer diagnosis and mortality data
and their associated covariates and risk factors.</docText>

        <docText>Design choices when architecting visualizations

In this paper, we focus on some of the key design decisions we
faced during the process of architecting a visualization system and
present some possible choices, with their associated advantages and
disadvantages. We frame this discussion within the context of Rivet, our
general visualization environment designed for rapidly prototyping
interactive, exploratory visualization tools for analysis. As we
designed increasingly sophisticated visualizations, we needed to refine
Rivet in order to be able to create these richer displays for larger and
more complex data sets. The design decisions we discuss in this paper
include: the internal data model, data access, semantic meta-data
information the visualization can use to create effective visual
decodings, the need for data transformations in a visualization tool,
modular objects for flexibility, and the tradeoff between simplicity and
expressiveness when providing methods for creating
visualizations.</docText>

        <docText>Edgelens: an interactive method for managing edge congestion in
graphs

An increasing number of tasks require people to explore,
navigate and search extremely complex data sets visualized as graphs.
Examples include electrical and telecommunication networks, Web
structures, and airline routes. The problem is that graphs of these real
world data sets have many interconnected nodes, ultimately leading to
edge congestion: the density of edges is so great that they obscure
nodes, individual edges, and even the visual information beneath the
graph. To address this problem we developed an interactive technique
called EdgeLens. An EdgeLens interactively curves graph edges away for a
person's focus attention without changing the node positions. This opens
up sufficient space to disambiguate node and edge relationships and to
see underlying information while still preserving node layout. Initially
two methods of creating this interaction were developed and compared in
a user study. The results of this study were used in the selection of a
basic approach and the subsequent development of the EdgeLens. We then
improved the EdgeLens through use of transparency and colour and by
allowing multiple lenses to appear on the graph.</docText>

        <docText>MoireGraphs: radial focus+context visualization and interaction
for graphs with visual nodes

Graph and tree visualization techniques enable interactive
exploration of complex relations while communicating topology. However,
most existing techniques have not been designed for situations where
visual information such as images is also present at each node and must
be displayed. This paper presents MoireGraphs to address this need.
MoireGraphs combine a new focus+context radial graph layout with a suite
of interaction techniques (focus strength changing, radial rotation,
level highlighting, secondary foci, animated transitions and node
information) to assist in the exploration of graphs with visual nodes.
The method is scalable to hundreds of displayed visual
nodes.</docText>

        <docText>Visualizing evolving networks: minimum spanning trees versus
pathfinder networks

Network evolution is an ubiquitous phenomenon in a wide
variety of complex systems. There is an increasing interest in
statistically modeling the evolution of complex networks such as
small-world networks and scale-free networks. In this article, we
address a practical issue concerning the visualizations of co-citation
networks of scientific publications derived by two widely known link
reduction algorithms, namely minimum spanning trees (MSTs) and
pathfinder networks (PFNETs). Our primary goal is to identify the
strengths and weaknesses of the two methods in fulfilling the need for
visualizing evolving networks. Two criteria are derived for assessing
visualizations of evolving networks in terms of topological properties
and dynamical properties. We examine the animated visualization models
of the evolution of botulinum toxin research in terms of its co-citation
structure across a 58-year span (1945-2002). The results suggest that
although high-degree nodes dominate the structure of MST models, such
structures can be inadequate in depicting the essence of how the network
evolves because MST removes potentially significant links from
high-order shortest paths. In contrast, PFNET models clearly demonstrate
their superiority in maintaining the cohesiveness of some of the most
pivotal paths, which in turn make the growth animation more predictable
and interpretable. We suggest that the design of visualization and
modeling tools for network evolution should take the cohesiveness of
critical paths into account.</docText>

        <docText>Dynamic visualization of transient data streams

We introduce two dynamic visualization techniques using
multidimensional scaling to analyze transient data streams such as
newswires and remote sensing imagery. While the time-sensitive nature of
these data streams requires immediate attention in many applications,
the unpredictable and unbounded characteristics of this information can
potentially overwhelm many scaling algorithms that require a full
re-computation for every update. We present an adaptive visualization
technique based on data stratification to ingest stream information
adaptively when influx rate exceeds processing rate. We also describe an
incremental visualization technique based on data fusion to project new
information directly onto a visualization subspace spanned by the
singular vectors of the previously processed neighboring data. The
ultimate goal is to leverage the value of legacy and new information and
minimize re-processing of the entire dataset in full resolution. We
demonstrate these dynamic visualization results using a newswire corpus
and a remote sensing imagery sequence.</docText>

        <docText>Interactive hierarchical dimension ordering, spacing and
filtering for exploration of high dimensional datasets

Large number of dimensions not only cause clutter in
multi-dimensional visualizations, but also make it difficult for users
to navigate the data space. Effective dimension management, such as
dimension ordering, spacing and filtering, is critical for visual
exploration of such datasets. Dimension ordering and spacing explicitly
reveal dimension relationships in arrangement-sensitive multidimensional
visualization techniques, such as parallel coordinates, star glyphs, and
pixel-oriented techniques. They facilitate the visual discovery of
patterns within the data. Dimension filtering hides some of the
dimensions to reduce clutter while preserving the major information of
the dataset. In this paper, we propose an interactive hierarchical
dimension ordering, spacing and filtering approach, called DOSFA. DOSFA
is based on dimension hierarchies derived from similarities among
dimensions. It is scalable multi-resolution approach making dimensional
management a tractable task. On the one hand, it automatically generates
default settings for dimension ordering, spacing and filtering. On the
other hand, it allows users to efficiently control all aspects of this
dimension management process via visual interaction tools for dimension
hierarchy manipulation. A case study visualizing a dataset containing
over 200 dimensions reveals high dimensional visualization
techniques.</docText>

        <docText>Mapping nominal values to numbers for effective
    visualization

Data sets with a large number of nominal variables, some with
high cardinality, are becoming increasingly common and need to be
explored. Unfortunately, most existing visual exploration displays are
designed to handle numeric variables only. When importing data sets with
nominal values into such visualization tools, most solutions to date are
rather simplistic. Often, techniques that map nominal values to numbers
do not assign order or spacing among the values in a manner that conveys
semantic relationships. Moreover, displays designed for nominal
variables usually cannot handle high cardinality variables well. This
paper addresses the problem of how to display nominal variables in
general-purpose visual exploration tools designed for numeric variables.
Specifically, we investigate (1) how to assign order and spacing among
the nominal values, and (2) how to reduce the number of distinct values
to display. We propose that nominal variables be pre-processed using a
distance-quantification-classing (DQC) approach before being imported
into a visual exploration tool. In the distance step, we identify a set
of independent dimensions that can be used to calculate the distance
between nominal values. In the quantification step, we use the
independent dimensions and the distance information to assign order and
spacing among the nominal values. In the classing step, we use results
from the previous steps to determine which values within a variable are
similar to each other and thus can be grouped together. Each step in the
DQC approach can be accomplished by a variety of techniques. We extended
the XmdvTool package to incorporate this approach. We evaluated our
approach on several data sets using a variety of evaluation
measures.</docText>

        <docText>Intelligently resolving point occlusion

Large and high-dimensional data sets mapped to low-dimensional
visualizations often result in perceptual ambiguities. One such
ambiguity is overlap or occlusion that occurs when the number of records
exceeds the number of unique locations in the presentation or when there
exist two or more records that map to the same location. To lessen the
affect of occlusion, non-standard visual attributes (i.e. shading and/or
transparency) are applied, or such records may be remapped to a
corresponding jittered location. The resulting mapping efficiently
portrays the crowding of records but fails to provide the insight into
the relationship between the neighboring records. We introduce a new
interactive technique that intelligibly organizes overlapped points, a
neural network-based smart jittering algorithm. We demonstrate this
technique on a scatter plot, the most widely used visualization. The
algorithm can be applied to other one, two, and multi-dimensional
visualizations which represent data as points, including 3-dimensional
scatter plots, RadViz, polar coordinates.</docText>

        <docText>Constant density displays using diversity
    sampling

The Informedia Digital Video Library user interface summarizes
query results with a collage of representative keyframes. We present a
user study in which keyframe occlusion caused difficulties. To use the
screen space most efficiently to display images, both occlusion and
wasted whitespace should be minimized. Thus optimal choices will tend
toward constant density displays. However, previous constant density
algorithms are based on global density, which leads to occlusion and
empty space if the density is not uniform. We introduce an algorithm
that considers the layout of individual objects and avoids occlusion
altogether. Efficiency concerns are important for dynamic summaries of
the Informedia Digital Video Library, which has hundreds of thousands of
shots. Posting multiple queries that take into account parameters of the
visualization as well as the original query reduces the amount of work
required. This greedy algorithm is then compared to an optimal one. The
approach is also applicable to visualizations containing complex
graphical objects other than images, such as text, icons, or
trees.</docText>

        <docText>Empirical comparison of dynamic query sliders and brushing
histograms

Dynamic queries facilitate rapid exploration of information by
real-time visual display of both query formulation and results. Dynamic
query sliders are linked to the main visualization to filter data. A
common alternative to dynamic queries is to link several simple
visualizations, such as histograms, to the main visualization with a
brushing interaction strategy. Selecting data in the histograms
highlights that data in the main visualization. We compare these two
approaches in an empirical experiment on DataMaps, a geographic data
visualization tool. Dynamic query sliders resulted in better performance
for simple range tasks, while brushing histograms was better for complex
trend evaluation and attribute relation tasks. Participants preferred
brushing histograms for understanding relationships between attributes
and the rich information they provided.</docText>

        <docText>Conveying shape with texture: an experimental investigation of
the impact of texture type on shape categorization judgments

As visualization researchers, we are interested in gaining a
better understanding of how to effectively use texture to facilitate
shape perception. If we could design the ideal texture pattern to apply
to an arbitrary smoothly curving shape to be most accurately and
effectively perceived, what would the characteristics of that texture
pattern be? In this paper we describe the results of a comprehensive
controlled observer experiment intended to yield insight into that
question. Here, we report the results of a new study comparing the
relative accuracy of observers' judgments of shape type (elliptical,
cylindrical, hyperbolic or flat) and shape orientation (convex, concave,
both, or neither) for local views of boundary masked quadric surface
patches under six different principal direction texture pattern
conditions plus two texture conditions (an isotropic pattern and a
non-principal direction oriented anisotropic pattern), under both
perspective and orthographic projection conditions and from both head-on
and oblique viewpoints. Our results confirm the hypothesis that accurate
shape perception is facilitated to a statistically significantly greater
extent by some principal direction texture patterns than by others.
Specifically, we found that, for both views, under conditions of
perspective projection, participants more often correctly identified the
shape category and the shape orientation when the surface was textured
with the pattern that contained oriented energy along both the first and
second principal directions only than in the case of any other texture
condition. Patterns containing markings following only one of the
principal directions, or containing information along other directions
in addition to the principal directions yielded poorer performance
overall.</docText>

        <docText>Coordinated graph and scatter-plot views for the visual
exploration of microarray time-series data

Microarrays are relatively new, high-throughput data
acquisition technology for investigating biological phenomena at the
micro-level. One of the more common procedures for microarray
experimentation is that of the microarray time-course experiment. The
product of microarray time-course experiment is time-series data, which
subject to proper analysis has the potential to have significant impact
on the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of diseases. While existing
information visualization techniques go some way to making microarray
time-series data more manageable, requirements analysis has revealed
significant limitations. The main finding was that users were unable to
uncover and quantify common changes in value over a specified
time-period. This paper describes a novel technique that provides this
functionality by allowing the user to visually formulate and modify
measurable queries with separate time-period and condition components.
These visual queries are supported by the combination of a traditional
value against time graph representation of the data with a complementary
scatter-plot representation of a specified time-period. The multiple
views of the visualization are coordinated so that the user can
formulate and modify queries with rapid reversible display of query
results in the traditional value against time graph
format.</docText>

        <docText>Causality visualization using animated growing
    polygons

We present Growing Polygons, a novel visualization technique
for the graphical representation of causal relations and information
flow in a system of interacting processes. Using this method, individual
processes are displayed as partitioned polygons with color-coded
segments showing dependencies to other processes. The entire
visualization is also animated to communicate the dynamic execution of
the system to the user. The results from a comparative user study of the
method show that the Growing Polygons technique is significantly more
efficient than the traditional Hasse diagram visualization for analysis
tasks related to deducing information flow in a system for both small
and large executions. Furthermore, our findings indicate that the
correctness when solving causality tasks is significantly improved using
our method. In addition, the subjective ratings of the users rank the
method as superior in all regards, including usability, efficiency, and
enjoyability.</docText>

        <docText>Visualization of large-scale customer satisfaction surveys using
a parallel coordinate tree

Satisfaction surveys are an important measurement tool in
fields such as market research or human resources management. Serious
studies consist of numerous questions and contain answers from large
population samples. Aggregation on both sides, the questions asked as
well as the answers received, turns the multidimensional problem into a
complex system of interleaved hierarchies. Traditional ways of
presenting the results are limited to one-dimensional charts and
cross-tables. We developed a visualization method called the Parallel
Coordinate Tree that combines multidimensional analysis with a tree
structure representation. Distortion-oriented focus+context techniques
are used to facilitate interaction with the visualization. In this paper
we present a design study of a commercial application that we built,
using this method to analyze and communicate results from large-scale
customer satisfaction surveys.</docText>

        <docText>FundExplorer: supporting the diversification of mutual fund
portfolios using context treemaps

An equity mutual fund is a financial instrument that invests
in a set of stocks. Any two different funds may partially invest in some
of the same stocks, thus overlap is common. Portfolio diversification
aims at spreading an investment over many different stocks in search of
greater returns. Helping people with portfolio diversification is
challenging because it requires informing them about both their current
portfolio of stocks held through funds and the other stocks in the
market not invested in yet. Current stock/fund visualization systems
either waste screen real estate and visualization of all data points. We
have developed a system called FundExplorer that implements a distorted
treemap to visualize both the amount of money invested in a person's
fund portfolio and the context of remaining market stocks. The
FundExplorer system enables people to interactively explore
diversification possibilities with their
portfolios.</docText>

        <docText>Thread Arcs: an email thread visualization

This paper describes Thread Arcs, a novel interactive visualization
technique designed to help people use threads found in email. Thread
Arcs combine the chronology of messages with the branching tree
structure of a conversational thread in a mixed-model visualization by
Venolia and Neustaedter (2003) that is stable and compact. By quickly
scanning and interacting with Thread Arcs, people can see various
attributes of conversations and find relevant messages in them
easily. We tested this technique against other visualization
techniques with users' own email in a functional prototype email
client. Thread Arcs proved an excellent match for the types of threads
found in users' email for the qualities users wanted in small-scale
visualizations.</docText>

        <docText>Between aesthetics and utility: designing
    ambient information visualizations

Unlike traditional information visualization, ambient information
visualizations reside in the environment of the user rather than on
the screen of a desktop computer. Currently, most dynamic information
that is displayed in public places consists of text and numbers. We
argue that information visualization can be employed to make such
dynamic data more useful and appealing. However, visualizations
intended for non-desktop spaces will have to both provide valuable
information and present an attractive addition to the environment -
they must strike a balance between aesthetical appeal and
usefulness. To explore this, we designed a real-time visualization of
bus departure times and deployed it in a public space, with about 300
potential users. To make the presentation more visually appealing, we
took inspiration from a modern abstract artist. The visualization was
designed in two passes. First, we did a preliminary version that was
presented to and discussed with prospective users. Based on their
input, we did a final design. We discuss the lessons learned in
designing this and previous ambient information visualizations,
including how visual art can be used as a design constraint, and how
the choice of information and the placement of the display affect the
visualization.</docText>

        <docText>ClusterSculptor: A Visual Analytics Tool for High-Dimensional Data

Cluster analysis (CA) is a powerful strategy for the exploration of high-dimensional data in the absence of a-priori hypotheses or data classification models, and the results of CA can then be used to form such models. But even though formal models and classification rules may not exist in these data exploration scenarios, domain scientists and experts generally have a vast amount of non-compiled knowledge and intuition that they can bring to bear in this effort. In CA, there are various popular mechanisms to generate the clusters, however, the results from their non- supervised deployment rarely fully agree with this expert knowledge and intuition. To this end, our paper describes a comprehensive and intuitive framework to aid scientists in the derivation of classification hierarchies in CA, using k-means as the overall clustering engine, but allowing them to tune its parameters interactively based on a non-distorted compact visual presentation of the inherent characteristics of the data in high- dimensional space. These include cluster geometry, composition, spatial relations to neighbors, and others. In essence, we provide all the tools necessary for a high-dimensional activity we call cluster sculpting, and the evolving hierarchy can then be viewed in a space-efficient radial dendrogram. We demonstrate our system in the context of the mining and classification of a large collection of millions of data items of aerosol mass spectra, but our framework readily applies to any high-dimensional CA scenario.</docText>

        <docText>Balancing Interactive Data Management of Massive Data with Situational Awareness through Smart Aggregation

Designing a visualization system capable of processing, managing, and presenting massive data sets while maximizing the user's situational awareness (SA) is a challenging, but important, research question in visual analytics. Traditional data management and interactive retrieval approaches have often focused on solving the data overload problem at the expense of the user's SA. This paper discusses various data management strategies and the strengths and limitations of each approach in providing the user with SA. A new data management strategy, coined Smart Aggregation, is presented as a powerful approach to overcome the challenges of both massive data sets and maintaining SA. By combining automatic data aggregation with user-defined controls on what, how, and when data should be aggregated, we present a visualization system that can handle massive amounts of data while affording the user with the best possible SA. This approach ensures that a system is always usable in terms of both system resources and human perceptual resources. We have implemented our Smart Aggregation approach in a visual analytics system called VIAssist (Visual Assistant for Information Assurance Analysis) to facilitate exploration, discovery, and SA in the domain of Information Assurance.</docText>

        <docText>IMAS: The Interactive Multigenomic Analysis System

This paper introduces a new Visual Analysis tool named IMAS (Interactive Multigenomic Analysis System), which combines common analysis tools such as Glimmer, BLAST, and Clustal-W into a unified Visual Analytic framework. IMAS displays the primary DNA sequence being analyzed by the biologist in a highly interactive, zoomable visual display. The user may analyze the sequence in a number of ways, and visualize these analyses in a coherent, sequence aligned form, with all related analysis products grouped together. This enables the user to rapidly perform analyses of DNA sequences without the need for tedious and error-prone cutting and pasting of sequence data from text files to and from web-based databases and data analysis services, as is now common practice.</docText>

        <docText>Constellation: a visualization tool for linguistic queries from MindNet

Constellation is a visualization system for the results of queries from the MindNet natural language semantic network. Constellation is targeted at helping MindNet's creators and users refine their algorithms, as opposed to understanding the structure of language. We designed a special-purpose graph layout algorithm which exploits higher-level structure in addition to the basic node and edge connectivity. Our layout prioritizes the creation of a semantic space to encode plausibility instead of traditional graph drawing metrics like minimizing edge crossings. We make careful use of several perceptual channels both to minimize the visual impact of edge crossings and to emphasize highlighted constellations of nodes and edges</docText>

        <docText>Visual Analytics Approach to User-Controlled Evacuation Scheduling

Application of the ideas of visual analytics is a promising approach to supporting decision making, in particular, where the problems have geographic (or spatial) and temporal aspects. Visual analytics may be especially helpful in time-critical applications, which pose hard challenges to decision support. We have designed a suite of tools to support transportation-planning tasks such as emergency evacuation of people from a disaster- affected area. The suite combines a tool for automated scheduling based on a genetic algorithm with visual analytics techniques allowing the user to evaluate tool results and direct its work. A transportation schedule, which is generated by the tool, is a complex construct involving geographical space, time, and heterogeneous objects (people and vehicles) with states and positions varying in time. We apply task-analytical approach to design techniques that could effectively support a human planner in the analysis of this complex information H. 1.2 [User/Machine Systems]: Human information processing - Visual Analytics; 1.6.9 [Visualization]: information visualization.</docText>

        <docText>A Java-based visual mining infrastructure and applications

Many real-world KDD (Knowledge Discovery &amp; Data Mining) applications involve the navigation of large volumes of information on the web, such as, Internet resources, hot topics, and telecom phone switches. Quite often users feel lost, confused and overwhelmed with displays that contain too much information. This paper discusses a new content-driven visual mining infrastructure called VisMine, that uses several innovative techniques: (1) hidden visual structure and relationships for uncluttering displays; (2) simultaneous visual presentations for high-dimensional knowledge discovery; and (3) a new visual interface to plug in existing graphic toolkits for expanding its use in a wide variety of visual applications. We have applied this infrastructure to three data mining visualization applications-topic hierarchy for document navigation, web-based trouble shooting, and telecom switch mining</docText>

Using mobile devices for visualization provides a ubiquitous environment for accessing information and effective decision making. These visualizations are critical in satisfying the knowledge needs of operators in areas as diverse as education, business, law enforcement, protective services, medical services, scientific discovery, and homeland security. In this paper, we present an efficient and interactive mobile visual analytic system for increased situational awareness and decision making in emergency response and training situations. Our system provides visual analytics with locational scene data within a simple interface tailored to mobile device capabilities. In particular, we focus on processing and displaying sensor network data for first responders. To verify our system, we have used simulated data of The Station nightclub fire evacuation.</docText>

        <docText>Visualizing association rules for text mining

An association rule in data mining is an implication of the form XY where X is a set of antecedent items and Y is the consequent item. For years researchers have developed many tools to visualize association rules. However, few of these tools can handle more than dozens of rules, and none of them can effectively manage rules with multiple antecedents. Thus, it is extremely difficult to visualize and understand the association information of a large data set even when all the rules are available. This paper presents a novel visualization technique to tackle many of these problems. We apply the technology to a text mining study on large corpora. The results indicate that our design can easily handle hundreds of multiple antecedent association rules in a three-dimensional display with minimum human interaction, low occlusion percentage, and no screen swapping</docText>

        <docText>LAHVA: Linked Animal-Human Health Visual Analytics

Coordinated animal-human health monitoring can provide an early warning system with fewer false alarms for naturally occurring disease outbreaks, as well as biological, chemical and environmental incidents. This monitoring requires the integration and analysis of multi-field, multi-scale and multi-source data sets. In order to better understand these data sets, models and measurements at different resolutions must be analyzed. To facilitate these investigations, we have created an application to provide a visual analytics framework for analyzing both human emergency room data and veterinary hospital data. Our integrated visual analytic tool links temporally varying geospatial visualization of animal and human patient health information with advanced statistical analysis of these multi-source data. Various statistical analysis techniques have been applied in conjunction with a spatio-temporal viewing window. Such an application provides researchers with the ability to visually search the data for clusters in both a statistical model view and a spatio-temporal view. Our interface provides a factor specification/filtering component to allow exploration of causal factors and spread patterns. In this paper, we will discuss the application of our linked animal-human visual analytics (LAHVA) tool to two specific case studies. The first case study is the effect of seasonal influenza and its correlation with different companion animals (e.g., cats, dogs) syndromes. Here we use data from the Indiana Network for Patient Care (INPC) and Banfield Pet Hospitals in an attempt to determine if there are correlations between respiratory syndromes representing the onset of seasonal influenza in humans and general respiratory syndromes in cats and dogs. Our second case study examines the effect of the release of industrial wastewater in a community through companion animal surveillance.</docText>

        <docText>The automated multidimensional detective

Automation has arrived to parallel coordinates. A geometrically motivated classifier is presented and applied, with both training and testing stages, to 3 real datasets. Our results compared to those from 33 other classifiers have the least error. The algorithm is based on parallel coordinates and has very low computational complexity in the number of variables and the size of the dataset-contrasted with the very high or unknown (often unstated) complexity of other classifiers, the low complexity enables the rule derivation to be done in near real-time hence making the classification adaptive to changing conditions, provides comprehensible and explicit rules-contrasted to neural networks which are black boxes, does dimensionality selection-where the minimal set of original variables (not transformed new variables as in Principal Component Analysis) required to state the rule is found, orders these variables so as to optimize the clarity of separation between the designated set and its complement-this solves the pesky ordering problem in parallel coordinates. The algorithm is display independent, hence it can be applied to very large in size and number of variables datasets. Though it is instructive to present the results visually, the input size is no longer display-limited as for visual data mining</docText>

        <docText>Stories in GeoTime

A story is a powerful abstraction used by intelligence analysts to conceptualize threats and understand patterns as part of the analytical process. This paper demonstrates a system that detects geo-temporal patterns and integrates story narration to increase analytic sense-making cohesion in GeoTime. The GeoTime geo-temporal event visualization tool was augmented with a story system that uses narratives, hypertext linked visualizations, visual annotations, and pattern detection to create an environment for analytic exploration and communication, thereby assisting the analyst in identifying, extracting, arranging and presenting stories within the data The story system lets analysts operate at the story level with higher-level abstractions of data, such as behaviors and events, while staying connected to the evidence. The story system was developed and evaluated in collaboration with analysts.</docText>

        <docText>FemaRepViz: Automatic Extraction and Geo-Temporal Visualization of FEMA National Situation Updates

An architecture for visualizing information extracted from text documents is proposed. In conformance with this architecture, a toolkit, FemaRepViz, has been implemented to extract and visualize temporal, geospatial, and summarized information from FEMA national update reports. Preliminary tests have shown satisfactory accuracy for FEMARepViz. A central component of the architecture is an entity extractor that extracts named entities like person names, location names, temporal references, etc. FEMARepViz is based on FactXtractor, an entity-extractor that works on text documents. The information extracted using FactXtractor is processed using GeoTagger, a geographical name disambiguation tool based on a novel clustering-based disambiguation algorithm. To extract relationships among entities, we propose a machine-learning based algorithm that uses a novel stripped dependency tree kernel. We illustrate and evaluate the usefulness of our system on the FEMA National Situation Updates. Daily reports are fetched by FEMARepViz from the FEMA website, segmented into coherent sections and each section is classified into one of several known incident types. We use concept Vista, Google maps and Google earth to visualize the events extracted from the text reports and allow the user to interactively filter the topics, locations, and time-periods of interest to create a visual analytics toolkit that is useful for rapid analysis of events reported in a large set of text documents.</docText>

        <docText>Aggregate Towers: scale sensitive visualization and decluttering of geospatial data

We have developed a technique, Aggregate Towers, that allows geospatial data to be visualized across a range of map scales. We use a combination of data aggregation algorithms and dynamically aggregating data markers (e.g., icons or symbols) to accommodate interactive zooming by a user while maintaining a representation that remains intuitive, consistent across multiple scales and uncluttered. This approach implicitly generates multiple levels of overview displays from a single set of underlying data</docText>

        <docText>Activity Analysis Using Spatio-Temporal Trajectory Volumes in Surveillance Applications

In this paper, we present a system to analyze activities and detect anomalies in a surveillance application, which exploits the intuition and experience of security and surveillance experts through an easy- to-use visual feedback loop. The multi-scale and location specific nature of behavior patterns in space and time is captured using a wavelet-based feature descriptor. The system learns the fundamental descriptions of the behavior patterns in a semi-supervised fashion by the higher order singular value decomposition of the space described by the training data. This training process is guided and refined by the users in an intuitive fashion. Anomalies are detected by projecting the test data into this multi-linear space and are visualized by the system to direct the attention of the user to potential problem spots. We tested our system on real-world surveillance data, and it satisfied the security concerns of the environment.</docText>

        <docText>Efficient multi-object dynamic query histograms

Dynamic queries offer continuous feedback during range queries, and have been shown to be effective and satisfying. Recent work has extended them to datasets of 100,000 objects and, separately, to queries involving relations among multiple objects. The latter work enables filtering houses by properties of their owners, for instance. Our primary concern is providing feedback from histograms during dynamic query. The height of each histogram bar shows the count of selected objects whose attribute value falls into a given range. Unfortunately, previous efficient algorithms for single object queries overcount in the case of multiple objects if for instance, a house has multiple owners. This paper presents an efficient algorithm that with high probability closely approximates the true counts</docText>

        <docText>3D interactive visualization for inter-cell dependencies of spreadsheets

This paper proposes a new technique to visualize dependencies among cells in a spreadsheet. In this way, the system firstly visualizes a spreadsheet on a plane in three-dimensional space, and draws arcs between interrelated cells. By allowing a user to select an arbitrary cell and lift it up with direct manipulation, the system utilizes the third dimension to ameliorate visual occlusion of crossing arcs. As the user lifts a focused cell up, the interrelated cells are lifted up together; thus hidden dataflow networks can be visually intelligible interactively. Because spreadsheets are aimed at calculation itself rather than appearances of outputs, their mechanism is relatively invisible and not obvious for ordinary users. Our visualization helps such users to understand structures and mechanism of spreadsheets</docText>

A new method is presented for the visualization of hierarchical information, such as directory structures and organization structures. Cushion treemaps inherit the elegance of standard treemaps: compact, space-filling displays of hierarchical information, based on recursive subdivision of a rectangular image space. Intuitive shading is used to provide insight in the hierarchical structure. During the subdivision, ridges are added per rectangle, which are rendered with a simple shading model. The result is a surface that consists of recursive cushions. The method is efficient, effective, easy to use and implement, and has a wide applicability</docText>

 We describe a system for analyzing the flow of traffic through Web sites. We decomposed the general path analysis problem into a set of distinct subproblems, and created a visual metaphor for analyzing each of them. Our system works off of multiple representations of the clickstream, and exposes the path extraction algorithms and data to the visual metaphors as Web services. We have combined the visual metaphors into a Web-based "path analysis portal" that lets the user easily switch between the different modes of analysis.</docText>

 Since the crash of the dot.coms, investors have gotten a lot more careful with where they place their money. Now more than ever it becomes really important for venture capitalists (VCs) to monitor the state of the startups market and continually update their investment strategy to suit the rapidly changing market conditions. This paper presents three new visualization metaphors (Spiral Map, TimeTicker, and Double Histogram) for monitoring the startups market. While we are focusing on the VC domain, the visual metaphors developed are general and can be easily applied to other domains.</docText>

        <docText>A hybrid layout algorithm for sub-quadratic multidimensional scaling

Many clustering and layout techniques have been used for structuring and visualising complex data. This paper is inspired by a number of such contemporary techniques and presents a novel hybrid approach based upon stochastic sampling, interpolation and spring models. We use Chalmers' 1996 O(N2) spring model as a benchmark when evaluating our technique, comparing layout quality and run times using data sets of synthetic and real data. Our algorithm runs in O(NN) and executes significantly faster than Chalmers' 1996 algorithm, whilst producing superior layouts. In reducing complexity and run time, we allow the visualisation of data sets of previously infeasible size. Our results indicate that our method is a solid foundation for interactive and visual exploration of data.</docText>

        <docText>Visual unrolling of network evolution and the analysis of dynamic discourse

 A new method for visualizing the class of incrementally evolving networks is presented. In addition to the intermediate states of the network it conveys the nature of the change between them by unrolling the dynamics of the network. Each modification is shown in a separate layer of a three-dimensional representation, where the stack of layers corresponds to a time line of the evolution. We focus on discourse networks as the driving application, but our method extends to any type of network evolving in similar ways.</docText>

        <docText>Dynamic hierarchy specification and visualization

This paper describes concepts that underlie the design and implementation of an information exploration system that allows users to impose arbitrary hierarchical organizations on their data. Such hierarchies allow a user to embed important semantic information into the hierarchy definition. Our goal is to recognize the significance of this implicit information and to utilize it in the hierarchy visualization. The innovative features of our system include the dynamic modification of the hierarchy definitions and the definition and implementation of a set of layout algorithms that utilize semantic information implicit in the tree construction</docText>

        <docText>Navigating hierarchies with structure-based brushes

Interactive selection is a critical component in exploratory visualization, allowing users to isolate subsets of the displayed information for highlighting, deleting, analysis, or focussed investigation. Brushing, a popular method for implementing the selection process, has traditionally been performed in either screen space or data space. We introduce the concept of a structure-based brush, which can be used to perform selection in hierarchically structured data sets. Our structure-based brush allows users to navigate hierarchies by specifying focal extents and level-of-detail on a visual representation of the structure. Proximity-based coloring, which maps similar colors to data that are closely related within the structure, helps convey both structural relationships and anomalies. We describe the design and implementation of our structure-based brushing tool. We also validate its usefulness using two distinct hierarchical visualization techniques, namely hierarchical parallel coordinates and tree-maps</docText>

        <docText>Domain analysis: a technique to design a user-centered visualization framework

Domain Analysis for Data Visualization (DADV) is a technique to use when investigating a domain where data visualizations are going to be designed and added to existing software systems. DADV was used to design the data visualization in VisEIO-LCA, which is a framework to visualize environmental data about products. Most of the visualizations are designed using the following stages: formatting data in tables, selecting visual structures, and rendering the data on the screen. Although many visualization authors perform implicit domain analysis, in this paper domain analysis is added explicitly to the process of designing visualizations with the goal of producing move usable software tools. Environmental Life-Cycle Assessment (LCA) is used as a test bed for this technique</docText>

A similarity metric based on the low-level content of images can be used to create a visualisation in which visually similar images are displayed close to each other. We are carrying out a series of experiments to evaluate the usefulness of this type of visualisation as an image browsing aid. The initial experiment, described, considered whether people would find a given photograph more quickly in a visualisation than in a randomly arranged grid of images. The results show that the subjects were faster with the visualisation, although in post-experiment interviews many of them said that they preferred the clarity and regularity of the grid. We describe an algorithm with which the best aspects of the two layout types can be combined</docText>

We believe that this study provides strong evidence for adding animated transitions in many applications with fixed spatial data where the user navigates around the data space</docText>

In the process of knowledge discovery, workers examine available information in order to make sense of it. By sensemaking, we mean interacting with and operating on the information with a variety of information processing mechanisms. Previously, we introduced a concept that uses the spreadsheet metaphor with cells containing visualizations of complex data. We extend and apply a cognitive model called visual sensemaking to the visualization spreadsheet. We use the task of making sense of a large Web site as a concrete example throughout the paper for demonstration. Using a variety of visualization techniques, such as the Disk Tree and Cone Tree, we show that the interactions of the visualization spreadsheet help users draw conclusions from the overall relationships of the entire information set </docText>

        <docText>Visualizing application behavior on superscalar processors

The advent of superscalar processors with out-of-order execution makes it increasingly difficult to determine how well an application is utilizing the processor and how to adapt the application to improve its performance. We describe a visualization system for the analysis of application behavior on superscalar processors. Our system provides an overview-plus-detail display of the application's execution. A timeline view of pipeline performance data shows the overall utilization of the pipeline. This information is displayed using multiple time scales, enabling the user to drill down from a high-level application overview to a focus region of hundreds of cycles. This region of interest is displayed in detail using an animated cycle-by-cycle view of the execution. This view shows how instructions are reordered and executed and how functional units are being utilized. Additional context views correlate instuctions in this detailed view with the relevant source code for the application. This allows the user to discover the root cause of the poor pipeline utilization and make changes to the application to improve its performance. This visualization system can be easily configured to display a variety of processor models and configurations. We demonstrate it for both the MXS and MMIX processor models</docText>

        <docText>ACE: a fast multiscale eigenvectors computation for drawing huge graphs

 We present an extremely fast graph drawing algorithm for very large graphs, which we term ACE (for Algebraic multigrid Computation of Eigenvectors). ACE exhibits an improvement of something like two orders of magnitude over the fastest algorithms we are aware of; it draws graphs of millions of nodes in less than a minute. ACE finds an optimal drawing by minimizing a quadratic energy function. The minimization problem is expressed as a generalized eigenvalue problem, which is rapidly solved using a novel algebraic multigrid technique. The same generalized eigenvalue problem seems to come up also in other fields, hence ACE appears to be applicable outside of graph drawing too.</docText>

        <docText>Cluster and calendar based visualization of time series data

A new method is presented to get an insight into univariate time series data. The problem addressed is how to identify patterns and trends on multiple time scales (days, weeks, seasons) simultaneously. The solution presented is to cluster similar daily data patterns, and to visualize the average patterns as graphs and the corresponding days on a calendar. This presentation provides a quick insight into both standard and exceptional patterns. Furthermore, it is well suited to interactive exploration. Two applications, numbers of employees present and energy consumption, are presented</docText>

        <docText>Multiple foci drill-down through tuple and attribute aggregation polyarchies in tabular data

 Information analysis often involves decomposing data into sub-groups to allow for comparison and identification of relationships. Breakdown Visualization provides a mechanism to support this analysis through user guided drill-down of polyarchical metadata. This metadata describes multiple hierarchical structures for organizing tuple aggregations and table attributes. This structure is seen in financial data, organizational structures, sport statistics, and other domains. A spreadsheet format enables comparison of visualizations at any level of the hierarchy. Breakdown Visualization allows users to drill-down a single hierarchy then pivot into another hierarchy within the same view. It utilizes a fix and move technique that allows users to select multiple foci for drill-down.</docText>

        <docText>Angular brushing of extended parallel coordinates

 In this paper we present angular brushing for parallel coordinates (PC) as a new approach to highlighting rational data-properties, i.e., features which - in a non-separable way - depend on two data dimensions. We also demonstrate smooth brushing as an intuitive tool for specifying nonbinary degree-of-interest functions (for focus+context visualization). We also briefly describe our implementation as well as its application to the visualization of CFD data.</docText>

        <docText>Interactive information visualization of a million items

 Existing information visualization techniques are usually limited to the display of a few thousand items. This article describes new interactive techniques capable of handling a million items (effectively visible and manageable on screen). We evaluate the use of hardware-based techniques available with newer graphics cards, as well as new animation techniques and non-standard graphical features such as stereovision and overlap count. These techniques have been applied to two popular information visualizations: treemaps and scatter plot diagrams; but are generic enough to be applied to other 2D representations as well.</docText>

        <docText>Arc diagrams: visualizing structure in strings

 This paper introduces a new visualization method, the arc diagram, which is capable of representing complex patterns of repetition in string data. Arc diagrams improve over previous methods such as dotplots because they scale efficiently for strings that contain many instances of the same subsequence. This paper describes design and implementation issues related to arc diagrams and shows how they may be applied to visualize such diverse data as music, text, and compiled code.</docText>

 Data-mining of information by the process of pattern discovery in protein sequences has been predominantly algorithm based. We discuss a visualization approach, which uses texture mapping and blending techniques to perform visual data-mining on text data obtained from discovering patterns in protein sequences. This visual approach, investigates the possibilities of representing text data in three dimensions and provides new possibilities of representing more dimensions of information in text data visualization and analysis. We also present a generic framework derived from this visualization approach to visualize text in biosequence data.</docText>

 Beamtrees are a new method for the visualization of large hierarchical data sets. Nodes are shown as stacked circular beams, such that both the hierarchical structure as well as the size of nodes are depicted. The dimensions of beams are calculated using a variation of the treemap algorithm. A small user study indicated that beamtrees are significantly more effective than nested treemaps and cushion treemaps for the extraction of global hierarchical information.</docText>

        <docText>A space-optimized tree visualization

 We describe a new method for the visualization of tree structured relational data. It can be used especially for the display of very large hierarchies in a 2-dimensional space. We discuss the advantages and limitations of current techniques of tree visualization. Our strategy is to optimize the drawing of trees in a geometrical plane and maximize the utilization of display space by allowing more nodes and links to be displayed at a limit screen resolution. We use the concept of enclosure to partition the entire display space into a collection of local regions that are assigned to all nodes in tree T for the display of their sub-trees and themselves. To enable the exploration of large hierarchies, we use a modified semantic zooming technique to view the detail of a particular part of the hierarchy at a time based on user's interest. Layout animation is also provided to preserve the mental map while the user is exploring the hierarchy by changing zoomed views.</docText>

        <docText>InterRing: an interactive tool for visually navigating and manipulating hierarchical structures

 Radial, space-filling (RSF) techniques for hierarchy visualization have several advantages over traditional node-link diagrams, including the ability to efficiently use the display space while effectively conveying the hierarchy structure. Several RSF systems and tools have been developed to date, each with varying degrees of support for interactive operations such as selection and navigation. We describe what we believe to be a complete set of desirable operations on hierarchical structures. We then present InterRing, an RSF hierarchy visualization system that supports a significantly more extensive set of these operations than prior systems. In particular, InterRing supports multi-focus distortions, interactive hierarchy reconfiguration, and both semi-automated and manual selection. We show the power and utility of these and other operations, and describe our on-going efforts to evaluate their effectiveness and usability.</docText>

        <docText>Case study: visualizing sets of evolutionary trees

 We describe a visualization tool which allows a biologist to explore a large set of hypothetical evolutionary trees. Interacting with such a dataset allows the biologist to identify distinct hypotheses about how different species or organisms evolved, which would not have been clear from traditional analyses. Our system integrates a point-set visualization of the distribution of hypothetical trees with detail views of an individual tree, or of a consensus tree summarizing a subset of trees. Efficient algorithms were required for the key tasks of computing distances between trees, finding consensus trees, and laying out the point-set visualization.</docText>

        <docText>Process visualization with levels of detail

 We demonstrate how we apply information visualization techniques to process monitoring. Virtual instruments are enhanced using history encoding instruments are capable of displaying the current value and the value from the near past. Multi-instruments are capable of displaying several data sources simultaneously. Levels of detail for virtual instruments are introduced where the screen area is inversely proportional to the information amount displayed. Furthermore the monitoring system is enhanced by using: 3D anchoring attachment of instruments to positions on a 3D model, collision avoidance a physically based spring model prevents instruments from overlapping, and focus+context rendering - giving the user a possibility to examine particular instruments in detail without loosing the context information.</docText>

 We present a novel tree browser that builds on the conventional node link tree diagrams. It adds dynamic rescaling of branches of the tree to best fit the available screen space, optimized camera movement, and the use of preview icons summarizing the topology of the branches that cannot be expanded. In addition, it includes integrated search and filter functions. This paper reflects on the evolution of the design and highlights the principles that emerged from it. A controlled experiment showed benefits for navigation to already previously visited nodes and estimation of overall tree topology.</docText>

        <docText>The illusion of perceived metric 3D structure

 A large body of results on the characteristics of human spatial vision suggests that space perception is distorted. Recent studies indicate that the geometry of visual space is best understood as Affine. If this is the case, it has far reaching implications on how 3D visualizations can be successfully employed. For instance, all attempts to build visualization systems where users are expected to discover relations based on Euclidean distances or shapes will be ineffective. Because visualization can, and sometimes do, employ all possible types of depth information and because the results from vision research usually concentrates on one or two such types, three experiments were performed under near optimal viewing conditions. The aim of the experiments was twofold: To test whether the earlier findings generalize to optimal viewing conditions and to get a sense of the size of the error under such conditions. The results show that the findings do generalize and that the errors are large. The implications of these results for successful visualizations are discussed.</docText>

        <docText>Graphical encoding for information visualization: an empirical study

 Research in several areas provides scientific guidance for use of graphical encoding to convey information in an information visualization display. By graphical encoding we mean the use of visual display elements such as icon color, shape, size, or position to convey information about objects represented by the icons. Literature offers inconclusive and often conflicting viewpoints, including the suggestion that the effectiveness of a graphical encoding depends on the type of data represented. Our empirical study suggests that the nature of the users' perceptual task is more indicative of the effectiveness of a graphical encoding than the type of data represented.</docText>

        <docText>Visualizing data with bounded uncertainty

 Visualization is a powerful way to facilitate data analysis, but it is crucial that visualization systems explicitly convey the presence, nature, and degree of uncertainty to users. Otherwise, there is a danger that data will be falsely interpreted, potentially leading to inaccurate conclusions. A common method for denoting uncertainty is to use error bars or similar techniques designed to convey the degree of statistical uncertainty. While uncertainty can often be modeled statistically, a second form of uncertainty, bounded uncertainty, can also arise that has very different properties than statistical uncertainty. Error bars should not be used for bounded uncertainty because they do not convey the correct properties, so a different technique should be used instead. We describe a technique for conveying bounded uncertainty in visualizations and show how it can be applied systematically to common displays of abstract charts and graphs. Interestingly, it is not always possible to show the exact degree of uncertainty, and in some cases it can only be displayed approximately.</docText>

        <docText>Efficient cartogram generation: a comparison

 Cartograms are a well-known technique for showing geography-related statistical information, such as population demographics and epidemiological data. The basic idea is to distort a map by resizing its regions according to a statistical parameter, but in a way that keeps the map recognizable. We deal with the problem of making continuous cartograms that strictly retain the topology of the input mesh. We compare two algorithms to solve the continuous cartogram problem. The first one uses an iterative relocation of the vertices based on scanlines. The second one is based on the Gridfit technique, which uses pixel-based distortion based on a quadtree-like data structure.</docText>

 Example-based graphics generation systems automatically create new information visualizations by learning from existing graphic examples. As part of the effort on developing a general-purpose example-based generation system, we are building a visual database of graphic examples. In this paper, we address two main issues involved in constructing such a database: example selection and example modeling. As a result, our work offers three unique contributions: First, we build a visual database that contains a diverse collection of well-designed examples. Second, we develop a feature-based scheme to model all examples uniformly and accurately. Third, our visual database brings several important implications to the area of information visualization.</docText>

        <docText>Visualization schemas for flexible information visualization

 Relational databases provide significant flexibility to organize, store, and manipulate an infinite variety of complex data collections. This flexibility is enabled by the concept of relational data schemas, which allow data owners to easily design custom databases according to their unique needs. However, user interfaces and information visualizations for accessing and utilizing databases have not kept pace with this level of flexibility. This paper introduces the concept of visualization schemas, based on the Snap-Together Visualization model, which are analogous to relational data schemas. Visualization schemas enable users to rapidly construct customized multiple-view visualizations for databases in a similarly flexible fashion without programming. Since the design of appropriate visualizations for a given database depends on the data schema, visualization schemas are a natural analogy to the data schema concept.</docText>

        <docText>Multiscale visualization using data cubes

 Most analysts start with an overview of the data before gradually refining their view to be more focused and detailed. Multiscale pan-and-zoom systems are effective because they directly support this approach. However generating abstract overviews of large data sets is difficult, and most systems take advantage of only one type of abstraction: visual abstraction. Furthermore, these existing systems limit the analyst to a single zooming path on their data and thus a single set of abstract views. This paper presents: (1) a formalism for describing multiscale visualizations of data cubes with both data and visual abstraction, and (2) a method for independently zooming along one or more dimensions by traversing a zoom graph with nodes at different levels of detail. As an example of how to design multiscale visualizations using our system, we describe four design patterns using our formalism. These design patterns show the effectiveness of multiscale visualization of general relational databases.</docText>

        <docText>Internet traffic: visualization, discovery, and very large displays

 For a decade, the ruling common wisdom for Internet traffic held that it was everywhere bursty: over periods lasting tens of milliseconds to hundreds, the traffic was either much below its average rate or much above. In other words, the traffic was not smooth, not staying at all times close to its average. It was bursty on the cable running down a street, carrying the merged traffic of a small number of cable modem users in one section of a town. It was bursty on the core fiber of an Internet service provider, carrying the merged traffic of thousands of users from all over the country. The Internet was designed to accommodate the bursty traffic. The routers and switches that forward traffic from one place to the next were designed for burstiness, and Internet service providers allocated traffic loads on the devices based on an assumption of burstiness. Recently, it was discovered that the old common wisdom is not true. Visualization played a fundamental role in the discovery. The old wisdom held up for links with a small numbers of users. But as the number of users increases, the burstiness dissipates, and the traffic becomes smooth. Design of the high-load part of the Internet needs to be rethought. The old wisdom had persisted for high-load links because the databases of traffic measurements from them are immense, and the traffic measurements had not been studied in their fullest detail, which is necessary to see the smoothing. Visualization tools allowed the detail to be seen, and allowed the verification of a mathematical theory that predicts the smoothing. To see the detail, individual visual displays were created that take up an amount of virtual screen real estate measured in hundreds of pages. It is a simple idea: if you have a lot of data, and you want to see it in detail, you need a lot of space. What is needed now is a rich set of ideas and methods for navigating such very large displays.</docText>

        <docText>Multi-Level Graph Layout on the GPU

This paper presents a new algorithm for force directed graph layout on the GPU. The algorithm, whose goal is to compute layouts accurately and quickly, has two contributions. The first contribution is proposing a general multi-level scheme, which is based on spectral partitioning. The second contribution is computing the layout on the GPU. Since the GPU requires a data parallel programming model, the challenge is devising a mapping of a naturally unstructured graph into a well-partitioned structured one. This is done by computing a balanced partitioning of a general graph. This algorithm provides a general multi-level scheme, which has the potential to be used not only for computation on the GPU, but also on emerging multi-core architectures. The algorithm manages to compute high quality layouts of large graphs in a fraction of the time required by existing algorithms of similar quality. An application for visualization of the topologies of ISP (Internet service provider) networks is presented.</docText>

        <docText>NodeTrix: a Hybrid Visualization of Social Networks

The need to visualize large social networks is growing as hardware capabilities make analyzing large networks feasible and many new data sets become available. Unfortunately, the visualizations in existing systems do not satisfactorily resolve the basic dilemma of being readable both for the global structure of the network and also for detailed analysis of local communities. To address this problem, we present NodeTrix, a hybrid representation for networks that combines the advantages of two traditional representations: node-link diagrams are used to show the global structure of a network, while arbitrary portions of the network can be shown as adjacency matrices to better support the analysis of communities. A key contribution is a set of interaction techniques. These allow analysts to create a NodeTrix visualization by dragging selections to and from node-link and matrix forms, and to flexibly manipulate the NodeTrix representation to explore the dataset and create meaningful summary visualizations of their findings. Finally, we present a case study applying NodeTrix to the analysis of the InfoVis 2004 coauthorship dataset to illustrate the capabilities of NodeTrix as both an exploration tool and an effective means of communicating results.</docText>

        <docText>Exploring Multiple Trees through DAG Representations

We present a directed acyclic graph visualisation designed to allow interaction with a set of multiple classification trees, specifically to find overlaps and differences between groups of trees and individual trees. The work is motivated by the need to find a representation for multiple trees that has the space-saving property of a general graph representation and the intuitive parent-child direction cues present in individual representation of trees. Using example taxonomic data sets, we describe augmentations to the common barycenter DAG layout method that reveal shared sets of child nodes between common parents in a clearer manner. Other interactions such as displaying the multiple ancestor paths of a node when it occurs in several trees, and revealing intersecting sibling sets within the context of a single DAG representation are also discussed.</docText>

        <docText>Visualizing Changes of Hierarchical Data using Treemaps

While the treemap is a popular method for visualizing hierarchical data, it is often difficult for users to track layout and attribute changes when the data evolve over time. When viewing the treemaps side by side or back and forth, there exist several problems that can prevent viewers from performing effective comparisons. Those problems include abrupt layout changes, a lack of prominent visual patterns to represent layouts, and a lack of direct contrast to highlight differences. In this paper, we present strategies to visualize changes of hierarchical data using treemaps. A new treemap layout algorithm is presented to reduce abrupt layout changes and produce consistent visual patterns. Techniques are proposed to effectively visualize the difference and contrast between two treemap snapshots in terms of the map items' colors, sizes, and positions. Experimental data show that our algorithm can achieve a good balance in maintaining a treemap's stability, continuity, readability, and average aspect ratio. A software tool is created to compare treemaps and generate the visualizations. User studies show that the users can better understand the changes in the hierarchy and layout, and more quickly notice the color and size differences using our method.</docText>

        <docText>Overview Use in Multiple Visual Information Resolution Interfaces

In interfaces that provide multiple visual information resolutions (VIR), low-VIR overviews typically sacrifice visual details for display capacity, with the assumption that users can select regions of interest to examine at higher VI Rs. Designers can create low VIRs based on multi-level structure inherent in the data, but have little guidance with single-level data. To better guide design tradeoff between display capacity and visual target perceivability, we looked at overview use in two multiple-VIR interfaces with high-VIR displays either embedded within, or separate from, the overviews. We studied two visual requirements for effective overview and found that participants would reliably use the low-VIR overviews only when the visual targets were simple and had small visual spans. Otherwise, at least 20% chose to use the high-VIR view exclusively. Surprisingly, neither of the multiple-VIR interfaces provided performance benefits when compared to using the high-VIR view alone. However, we did observe benefits in providing side-by-side comparisons for target matching. We conjecture that the high cognitive load of multiple-VIR interface interactions, whether real or perceived, is a more considerable barrier to their effective use than was previously considered.</docText>

        <docText>Weaving Versus Blending: a quantitative assessment of the information carrying capacities of two alternative methods for conveying multivariate data with color.

In many applications, it is important to understand the individual values of, and relationships between, multiple related scalar variables defined across a common domain. Several approaches have been proposed for representing data in these situations. In this paper we focus on strategies for the visualization of multivariate data that rely on color mixing. In particular, through a series of controlled observer experiments, we seek to establish a fundamental understanding of the information-carrying capacities of two alternative methods for encoding multivariate information using color: color blending and color weaving. We begin with a baseline experiment in which we assess participants' abilities to accurately read numerical data encoded in six different basic color scales defined in the L*a*b* color space. We then assess participants' abilities to read combinations of 2, 3, 4 and 6 different data values represented in a common region of the domain, encoded using either color blending or color weaving. In color blending a single mixed color is formed via linear combination of the individual values in L*a*b* space, and in color weaving the original individual colors are displayed side-by-side in a high frequency texture that fills the region. A third experiment was conducted to clarify some of the trends regarding the color contrast and its effect on the magnitude of the error that was observed in the second experiment. The results indicate that when the component colors are represented side-by-side in a high frequency texture, most participants' abilities to infer the values of individual components are significantly improved, relative to when the colors are blended. Participants' performance was significantly better with color weaving particularly when more than 2 colors were used, and even when the individual colors subtended only 3 minutes of visual angle in the texture. However, the information-carrying capacity of the color weaving approach has its limits. - - We found that participants' abilities to accurately interpret each of the individual components in a high frequency color texture typically falls off as the number of components increases from 4 to 6. We found no significant advantages, in either color blending or color weaving, to using color scales based on component hues thatare more widely separated in the L*a*b* color space. Furthermore, we found some indications that extra difficulties may arise when opponent hues are employed.</docText>

        <docText>Spatialization Design: Comparing Points and Landscapes

Spatializations represent non-spatial data using a spatial layout similar to a map. We present an experiment comparing different visual representations of spatialized data, to determine which representations are best for a non-trivial search and point estimation task. Primarily, we compare point-based displays to 2D and 3D information landscapes. We also compare a colour (hue) scale to a grey (lightness) scale. For the task we studied, point-based spatializations were far superior to landscapes, and 2D landscapes were superior to 3D landscapes. Little or no benefit was found for redundantly encoding data using colour or greyscale combined with landscape height. 3D landscapes with no colour scale (height-only) were particularly slow and inaccurate. A colour scale was found to be better than a greyscale for all display types, but a greyscale was helpful compared to height-only. These results suggest that point-based spatializations should be chosen over landscape representations, at least for tasks involving only point data itself rather than derived information about the data space.</docText>

        <docText>Visualizing Causal Semantics Using Animations

Michotte's theory of ampliation suggests that causal relationships are perceived by objects animated under appropriate spatiotemporal conditions. We extend the theory of ampliation and propose that the immediate perception of complex causal relations is also dependent on a set of structural and temporal rules. We designed animated representations, based on Michotte's rules, for showing complex causal relationships or causal semantics. In this paper we describe a set of animations for showing semantics such as causal amplification, causal strength, causal dampening, and causal multiplicity. In a two part study we compared the effectiveness of both the static and animated representations. The first study (N=44) asked participants to recall passages that were previously displayed using both types of representations. Participants were 8% more accurate in recalling causal semantics when they were presented using animations instead of static graphs. In the second study (N=112) we evaluated the intuitiveness of the representations. Our results showed that while users were as accurate with the static graphs as with the animations, they were 9% faster in matching the correct causal statements in the animated condition. Overall our results show that animated diagrams that are designed based on perceptual rules such as those proposed by Michotte have the potential to facilitate comprehension of complex causal relations.</docText>

        <docText>Browsing Zoomable Treemaps: Structure-Aware Multi-Scale Navigation Techniques

Treemaps provide an interesting solution for representing hierarchical data. However, most studies have mainly focused on layout algorithms and paid limited attention to the interaction with treemaps. This makes it difficult to explore large data sets and to get access to details, especially to those related to the leaves of the trees. We propose the notion of zoomable treemaps (ZTMs), an hybridization between treemaps and zoomable user interfaces that facilitates the navigation in large hierarchical data sets. By providing a consistent set of interaction techniques, ZTMs make it possible for users to browse through very large data sets (e.g., 700,000 nodes dispatched amongst 13 levels). These techniques use the structure of the displayed data to guide the interaction and provide a way to improve interactive navigation in treemaps.</docText>

        <docText>Animated Transitions in Statistical Data Graphics

In this paper we investigate the effectiveness of animated transitions between common statistical data graphics such as bar charts, pie charts, and scatter plots. We extend theoretical models of data graphics to include such transitions, introducing a taxonomy of transition types. We then propose design principles for creating effective transitions and illustrate the application of these principles in DynaVis, a visualization system featuring animated data graphics. Two controlled experiments were conducted to assess the efficacy of various transition types, finding that animated transitions can significantly improve graphical perception.</docText>

        <docText>Interactive Tree Comparison for Co-located Collaborative Information Visualization

In many domains, increased collaboration has lead to more innovation by fostering the sharing of knowledge, skills, and ideas. Shared analysis of information visualizations does not only lead to increased information processing power, but team members can also share, negotiate, and discuss their views and interpretations on a dataset and contribute unique perspectives on a given problem. Designing technologies to support collaboration around information visualizations poses special challenges and relatively few systems have been designed. We focus on supporting small groups collaborating around information visualizations in a co-located setting, using a shared interactive tabletop display. We introduce an analysis of challenges and requirements for the design of co-located collaborative information visualization systems. We then present a new system that facilitates hierarchical data comparison tasks for this type of collaborative work. Our system supports multi-user input, shared and individual views on the hierarchical data visualization, flexible use of representations, and flexible workspace organization to facilitate group work around visualizations.</docText>

        <docText>Toward a Deeper Understanding of the Role of Interaction in Information Visualization

Even though interaction is an important part of information visualization (Infovis), it has garnered a relatively low level of attention from the Infovis community. A few frameworks and taxonomies of Infovis interaction techniques exist, but they typically focus on low-level operations and do not address the variety of benefits interaction provides. After conducting an extensive review of Infovis systems and their interactive capabilities, we propose seven general categories of interaction techniques widely used in Infovis: 1) Select, 2) Explore, 3) Reconfigure, 4) Encode, 5) Abstract/Elaborate, 6) Filter, and 7) Connect. These categories are organized around a user's intent while interacting with a system rather than the low-level interaction techniques provided by a system. The categories can act as a framework to help discuss and evaluate interaction techniques and hopefully lay an initial foundation toward a deeper understanding and a science of interaction.</docText>

        <docText>A Taxonomy of Clutter Reduction for Information Visualisation

Information visualisation is about gaining insight into data through a visual representation. This data is often multivariate and increasingly, the datasets are very large. To help us explore all this data, numerous visualisation applications, both commercial and research prototypes, have been designed using a variety of techniques and algorithms. Whether they are dedicated to geo-spatial data or skewed hierarchical data, most of the visualisations need to adopt strategies for dealing with overcrowded displays, brought about by too much data to fit in too small a display space. This paper analyses a large number of these clutter reduction methods, classifying them both in terms of how they deal with clutter reduction and more importantly, in terms of the benefits and losses. The aim of the resulting taxonomy is to act as a guide to match techniques to problems where different criteria may have different importance, and more importantly as a means to critique and hence develop existing and new techniques.</docText>

        <docText>Sequential Document Visualization

Documents and other categorical valued time series are often characterized by the frequencies of short range sequential patterns such as n-grams. This representation converts sequential data of varying lengths to high dimensional histogram vectors which are easily modeled by standard statistical models. Unfortunately, the histogram representation ignores most of the medium and long range sequential dependencies making it unsuitable for visualizing sequential data. We present a novel framework for sequential visualization of discrete categorical time series based on the idea of local statistical modeling. The framework embeds categorical time series as smooth curves in the multinomial simplex summarizing the progression of sequential trends. We discuss several visualization techniques based on the above framework and demonstrate their usefulness for document visualization.</docText>

        <docText>Visualization of Heterogeneous Data

Both the resource description framework (RDF), used in the semantic web, and Maya Viz u-forms represent data as a graph of objects connected by labeled edges. Existing systems for flexible visualization of this kind of data require manual specification of the possible visualization roles for each data attribute. When the schema is large and unfamiliar, this requirement inhibits exploratory visualization by requiring a costly up-front data integration step. To eliminate this step, we propose an automatic technique for mapping data attributes to visualization attributes. We formulate this as a schema matching problem, finding appropriate paths in the data model for each required visualization attribute in a visualization template.</docText>

        <docText>VisLink: Revealing Relationships Amongst Visualizations

We present VisLink, a method by which visualizations and the relationships between them can be interactively explored. VisLink readily generalizes to support multiple visualizations, empowers inter-representational queries, and enables the reuse of the spatial variables, thus supporting efficient information encoding and providing for powerful visualization bridging. Our approach uses multiple 2D layouts, drawing each one in its own plane. These planes can then be placed and re-positioned in 3D space: side by side, in parallel, or in chosen placements that provide favoured views. Relationships, connections, and patterns between visualizations can be revealed and explored using a variety of interaction techniques including spreading activation and search filters.</docText>

        <docText>Hotmap: Looking at Geographic Attention

Understanding how people use online maps allows data acquisition teams to concentrate their efforts on the portions of the map that are most seen by users. Online maps represent vast databases, and so it is insufficient to simply look at a list of the most-accessed URLs. Hotmap takes advantage of the design of a mapping system's imagery pyramid to superpose a heatmap of the log files over the original maps. Users' behavior within the system can be observed and interpreted. This paper discusses the imagery acquisition task that motivated Hotmap, and presents several examples of information that Hotmap makes visible. We discuss the design choices behind Hotmap, including logarithmic color schemes; low-saturation background images; and tuning images to explore both infrequently-viewed and frequently-viewed spaces.</docText>

        <docText>Interactive Visual Exploration of a Large Spatio-temporal Dataset: Reflections on a Geovisualization Mashup.

Exploratory visual analysis is useful for the preliminary investigation of large structured, multifaceted spatio-temporal datasets. This process requires the selection and aggregation of records by time, space and attribute, the ability to transform data and the flexibility to apply appropriate visual encodings and interactions. We propose an approach inspired by geographical 'mashups' in which freely-available functionality and data are loosely but flexibly combined using de facto exchange standards. Our case study combines MySQL, PHP and the LandSerf GIS to allow Google Earth to be used for visual synthesis and interaction with encodings described in KML. This approach is applied to the exploration of a log of 1.42 million requests made of a mobile directory service. Novel combinations of interaction and visual encoding are developed including spatial 'tag clouds', 'tag maps', 'data dials' and multi-scale density surfaces. Four aspects of the approach are informally evaluated: the visual encodings employed, their success in the visual exploration of the dataset, the specific tools used and the 'mashup' approach. Preliminary findings will be beneficial to others considering using mashups for visualization. The specific techniques developed may be more widely applied to offer insights into the structure of multifarious spatio-temporal data of the type explored here.</docText>

Numerous systems have been developed to display large collections of data for urban contexts; however, most have focused on layering of single dimensions of data and manual calculations to understand relationships within the urban environment. Furthermore, these systems often limit the user's perspectives on the data, thereby diminishing the user's spatial understanding of the viewing region. In this paper, we introduce a highly interactive urban visualization tool that provides intuitive understanding of the urban data. Our system utilizes an aggregation method that combines buildings and city blocks into legible clusters, thus providing continuous levels of abstraction while preserving the user's mental model of the city. In conjunction with a 3D view of the urban model, a separate but integrated information visualization view displays multiple disparate dimensions of the urban data, allowing the user to understand the urban environment both spatially and cognitively in one glance. For our evaluation, expert users from various backgrounds viewed a real city model with census data and confirmed that our system allowed them to gain more intuitive and deeper understanding of the urban model from different perspectives and levels of abstraction than existing commercial urban visualization systems.</docText>

        <docText>Visualizing the History of Living Spaces

The technology available to building designers now makes it possible to monitor buildings on a very large scale. Video cameras and motion sensors are commonplace in practically every office space, and are slowly making their way into living spaces. The application of such technologies, in particular video cameras, while improving security, also violates privacy. On the other hand, motion sensors, while being privacy-conscious, typically do not provide enough information for a human operator to maintain the same degree of awareness about the space that can be achieved by using video cameras. We propose a novel approach in which we use a large number of simple motion sensors and a small set of video cameras to monitor a large office space. In our system we deployed 215 motion sensors and six video cameras to monitor the 3,000-square-meter office space occupied by 80 people for a period of about one year. The main problem in operating such systems is finding a way to present this highly multidimensional data, which includes both spatial and temporal components, to a human operator to allow browsing and searching recorded data in an efficient and intuitive way. In this paper we present our experiences and the solutions that we have developed in the course of our work on the system. We consider this work to be the first step in helping designers and managers of building systems gain access to information about occupants' behavior in the context of an entire building in a way that is only minimally intrusive to the occupants' privacy.</docText>

        <docText>Geographically Weighted Visualization: Interactive Graphics for Scale-Varying Exploratory Analysis

We introduce a series of geographically weighted (GW) interactive graphics, or geowigs, and use them to explore spatial relationships at a range of scales. We visually encode information about geographic and statistical proximity and variation in novel ways through gw-choropleth maps, multivariate gw-boxplots, gw-shading and scalograms. The new graphic types reveal information about GW statistics at several scales concurrently. We impement these views in prototype software containing dynamic links and GW interactions that encourage exploration and refine them to consider directional geographies. An informal evaluation uses interactive GW techniques to consider Guerry's dataset of 'moral statistics', casting doubt on correlations originally proposed through visual analysis, revealing new local anomalies and suggesting multivariate geographic relationships. Few attempts at visually synthesising geography with multivariate statistical values at multiple scales have been reported. The geowigs proposed here provide informative representations of multivariate local variation, particularly when combined with interactions that coordinate views and result in gw-shading. We argue that they are widely applicable to area and point-based geographic data and provide a set of methods to support visual analysis using GW statistics through which the effects of geography can be explored at multiple scales.</docText>

        <docText>Casual Information Visualization: Depictions of Data in Everyday Life

Information visualization has often focused on providing deep insight for expert user populations and on techniques for amplifying cognition through complicated interactive visual models. This paper proposes a new subdomain for infovis research that complements the focus on analytic tasks and expert use. Instead of work-related and analytically driven infovis, we propose casual information visualization (or casual infovis) as a complement to more traditional infovis domains. Traditional infovis systems, techniques, and methods do not easily lend themselves to the broad range of user populations, from expert to novices, or from work tasks to more everyday situations. We propose definitions, perspectives, and research directions for further investigations of this emerging subfield. These perspectives build from ambient information visualization (Skog et al., 2003), social visualization, and also from artistic work that visualizes information (Viegas and Wattenberg, 2007). We seek to provide a perspective on infovis that integrates these research agendas under a coherent vocabulary and framework for design. We enumerate the following contributions. First, we demonstrate how blurry the boundary of infovis is by examining systems that exhibit many of the putative properties of infovis systems, but perhaps would not be considered so. Second, we explore the notion of insight and how, instead of a monolithic definition of insight, there may be multiple types, each with particular characteristics. Third, we discuss design challenges for systems intended for casual audiences. Finally we conclude with challenges for system evaluation in this emerging subfield.</docText>

        <docText>Show Me: Automatic Presentation for Visual Analysis

This paper describes Show Me, an integrated set of user interface commands and defaults that incorporate automatic presentation into a commercial visual analysis system called Tableau. A key aspect of Tableau is VizQL, a language for specifying views, which is used by Show Me to extend automatic presentation to the generation of tables of views (commonly called small multiple displays). A key research issue for the commercial application of automatic presentation is the user experience, which must support the flow of visual analysis. User experience has not been the focus of previous research on automatic presentation. The Show Me user experience includes the automatic selection of mark types, a command to add a single field to a view, and a pair of commands to build views for multiple fields. Although the use of these defaults and commands is optional, user interface logs indicate that Show Me is used by commercial users.</docText>

        <docText>Scented Widgets: Improving Navigation Cues with Embedded Visualizations

This paper presents scented widgets, graphical user interface controls enhanced with embedded visualizations that facilitate navigation in information spaces. We describe design guidelines for adding visual cues to common user interface widgets such as radio buttons, sliders, and combo boxes and contribute a general software framework for applying scented widgets within applications with minimal modifications to existing source code. We provide a number of example applications and describe a controlled experiment which finds that users exploring unfamiliar data make up to twice as many unique discoveries using widgets imbued with social navigation data. However, these differences equalize as familiarity with the data increases.</docText>

        <docText>ManyEyes: a Site for Visualization at Internet Scale

We describe the design and deployment of Many Eyes, a public Web site where users may upload data, create interactive visualizations, and carry on discussions. The goal of the site is to support collaboration around visualizations at a large scale by fostering a social style of data analysis in which visualizations not only serve as a discovery tool for individuals but also as a medium to spur discussion among users. To support this goal, the site includes novel mechanisms for end-user creation of visualizations and asynchronous collaboration around those visualizations. In addition to describing these technologies, we provide a preliminary report on the activity of our users.</docText>

        <docText>AdaptiviTree: Adaptive Tree Visualization for Tournament-Style Brackets

Online pick'em games, such as the recent NCAA college basketball March Madness tournament, form a large and rapidly growing industry. In these games, players make predictions on a tournament bracket that defines which competitors play each other and how they proceed toward a single champion. Throughout the course of the tournament, players monitor the brackets to track progress and to compare predictions made by multiple players. This is often a complex sense making task. The classic bracket visualization was designed for use on paper and utilizes an incrementally additive system in which the winner of each match-up is rewritten in the next round as the tournament progresses. Unfortunately, this representation requires a significant amount of space and makes it relatively difficult to get a quick overview of the tournament state since competitors take arbitrary paths through the static bracket. In this paper, we present AdaptiviTree, a novel visualization that adaptively deforms the representation of the tree and uses its shape to convey outcome information. AdaptiviTree not only provides a more compact and understandable representation, but also allows overlays that display predictions as well as other statistics. We describe results from a lab study we conducted to explore the efficacy of AdaptiviTree, as well as from a deployment of the system in a recent real-world sports tournament.</docText>

        <docText>Visual Analysis of Network Traffic for Resource Planning, Interactive Monitoring, and Interpretation of Security Threats

The Internet has become a wild place: malicious code is spread on personal computers across the world, deploying botnets ready to attack the network infrastructure. The vast number of security incidents and other anomalies overwhelms attempts at manual analysis, especially when monitoring service provider backbone links. We present an approach to interactive visualization with a case study indicating that interactive visualization can be applied to gain more insight into these large data sets. We superimpose a hierarchy on IP address space, and study the suitability of Treemap variants for each hierarchy level. Because viewing the whole IP hierarchy at once is not practical for most tasks, we evaluate layout stability when eliding large parts of the hierarchy, while maintaining the visibility and ordering of the data of interest.</docText>

        <docText>Turning information visualization innovations into commercial products: lessons to guide the next success

 As information visualization matures as an academic research field, commercial spinoffs are proliferating, but success stories are harder to find. This is the normal process of emergence for new technologies, but the panel organizers believe that there are certain strategies that facilitate success. To teach these lessons, we have invited several key figures who are seeking to commercialize information visualization tools. The panelists make short presentations, engage in a moderated discussion, and respond to audience questions.</docText>

        <docText>Interactive Sankey diagrams

 We present a system that allows users to interactively explore complex flow scenarios represented as Sankey diagrams. Our system provides an overview of the flow graph and allows users to zoom in and explore details on demand. The support for quantitative flow tracing across the flow graph as well as representations at different levels of detail facilitate the understanding of complex flow situations. The energy flow in a city serves as a sample scenario for our system. Different forms of energy are distributed within the city and they are transformed into heat, electricity, or other forms of energy. These processes are visualized and interactively explored. In addition our system can be used as a planning tool for the exploration of alternative scenarios by interactively manipulating different parameters in the energy flow network.</docText>

        <docText>Visualization of graphs with associated timeseries data

 The most common approach to support analysis of graphs with associated time series data include: overlay of data on graph vertices for one timepoint at a time by manipulating a visual property (e.g. color) of the vertex, along with sliders or some such mechanism to animate the graph for other timepoints. Alternatively, data from all the timepoints can be overlaid simultaneously by embedding small charts into graph vertices. These graph visualizations may also be linked to other visualizations (e.g., parallel co-ordinates) using brushing and linking. This paper describes a study performed to evaluate and rank graph+timeseries visualization options based on users' performance time and accuracy of responses on predefined tasks. The results suggest that overlaying data on graph vertices one timepoint at a time may lead to more accurate performance for tasks involving analysis of a graph at a single timepoint, and comparisons between graph vertices for two distinct timepoints. Overlaying data simultaneously for all the timepoints on graph vertices may lead to more accurate and faster performance for tasks involving searching for outlier vertices displaying different behavior than the rest of the graph vertices for all timepoints. Single views have advantage over multiple views on tasks that require topological information. Also, the number of attributes displayed on nodes has a non trivial influence on accuracy of responses, whereas the number of visualizations affect the performance time.</docText>

        <docText>Flow map layout

 Cartographers have long used flow maps to show the movement of objects from one location to another, such as the number of people in a migration, the amount of goods being traded, or the number of packets in a network. The advantage of flow maps is that they reduce visual clutter by merging edges. Most flow maps are drawn by hand and there are few computer algorithms available. We present a method for generating flow maps using hierarchical clustering given a set of nodes, positions, and flow data between the nodes. Our techniques are inspired by graph layout algorithms that minimize edge crossings and distort node positions while maintaining their relative position to one another. We demonstrate our technique by producing flow maps for network traffic, census data, and trade data.</docText>

        <docText>Temporal visualization of planning polygons for efficient partitioning of geo-spatial data

 Partitioning of geo-spatial data for efficient allocation of resources such as schools and emergency health care services is driven by a need to provide better and more effective services. Partitioning of spatial data is a complex process that depends on numerous factors such as population, costs incurred in deploying or utilizing resources and target capacity of a resource. Moreover, complex data such as population distributions are dynamic i.e. they may change over time. Simple animation may not effectively show temporal changes in spatial data. We propose the use of three temporal visualization techniques -wedges, rings and time slices - to display the nature of change in temporal data in a single view. Along with maximizing resource utilization and minimizing utilization costs, a partition should also ensure the long term effectiveness of the plan. We use multi-attribute visualization techniques to highlight the strengths and identify the weaknesses of a partition. Comparative visualization techniques allow multiple partitions to be viewed simultaneously. Users can make informed decisions about how to partition geo spatial data by using a combination of our techniques for multi-attribute visualization, temporal visualization and comparative visualization.</docText>

        <docText>Importance-driven visualization layouts for large time series data

 Time series are an important type of data with applications in virtually every aspect of the real world. Often a large number of time series have to be monitored and analyzed in parallel. Sets of time series may show intrinsic hierarchical relationships and varying degrees of importance among the individual time series. Effective techniques for visually analyzing large sets of time series should encode the relative importance and hierarchical ordering of the time series data by size and position, and should also provide a high degree of regularity in order to support comparability by the analyst. In this paper, we present a framework for visualizing large sets of time series. Based on the notion of inter time series importance relationships, we define a set of objective functions that space-filling layout schemes for time series data should obey. We develop an efficient algorithm addressing the identified problems by generating layouts that reflect hierarchy and importance based relationships in a regular layout with favorable aspect ratios. We apply our technique to a number of real world data sets including sales and stock data, and we compare our technique with an aspect ratio aware variant of the well known TreeMap algorithm. The examples show the advantages and practical usefulness of our layout algorithm.</docText>

        <docText>Adapting the cognitive walkthrough method to assess the usability of a knowledge domain visualization

 The usability of knowledge domain visualization (KDViz) tools can be assessed at several levels. Cognitive walkthrough (CW) is a well known usability inspection method that focuses on how easily users can learn software through exploration. Typical applications of CW follow structured tasks where user goals and action sequences that lead to achievement of the goals are well defined. KDViz and other information visualization tools, however, are typically designed for users to explore data and user goals and actions are less well understood. In this paper, we describe how the traditional CW method may be adapted for assessing the usability of these systems. We apply the adapted version of CW to CiteSpace, a KDViz tool that uses bibliometric analyses to create visualizations of scientific literatures. We describe usability issues identified by the adapted CW and discuss how CiteSpace supported the completion of tasks, such as identifying research fronts, and the achievement of goals. Finally, we discuss improvements to the adapted CW and issues to be addressed before applying it to a wider range of KDViz tools.</docText>

        <docText>An optimization-based approach to dynamic visual context management

 We are building an intelligent multimodal conversation system to aid users in exploring large and complex data sets. To tailor to diverse user queries introduced during a conversation, we automate the generation of system responses, including both spoken and visual outputs. In this paper, we focus on the problem of visual context management, a process that dynamically updates an existing visual display to effectively incorporate new information requested by subsequent user queries. Specifically, we develop an optimization based approach to visual context management. Compared to existing approaches, which normally handle predictable visual context updates, our work offers two unique contributions. First, we provide a general computational framework that can effectively manage a visual context for diverse, unanticipated situations encountered in a user system conversation. Moreover, we optimize the satisfaction of both semantic and visual constraints, which otherwise are difficult to balance using simple heuristics. Second, we present an extensible representation model that uses feature based metrics to uniformly define all constraints. We have applied our work to two different applications and our evaluation has shown the promise of this work.</docText>

        <docText>A note on space-filling visualizations and space-filling curves

 A recent line of treemap research has focused on layout algorithms that optimize properties such as stability, preservation of ordering information, and aspect ratio of rectangles. No ideal treemap layout algorithm has been found, and so it is natural to explore layouts that produce nonrectangular regions. This note describes a connection between space-filling visualizations and the mathematics of space-filling curves, and uses that connection to characterize a family of layout algorithms which produce nonrectangular regions but enjoy geometric continuity under changes to the data and legibility even for highly unbalanced trees.</docText>

        <docText>Two-tone pseudo coloring: compact visualization for one-dimensional data

 A new pseudo coloring technique for large scale one-dimensional datasets is proposed. For visualization of a large scale dataset, user interaction is indispensable for selecting focus areas in the dataset. However, excessive switching of the visualized image makes it difficult for the user to recognize overview/ detail and detail/ detail relationships. The goal of this research is to develop techniques for visualizing details as precisely as possible in overview display. In this paper, visualization of a one-dimensional but very large dataset is considered. The proposed method is based on pseudo coloring, however, each scalar value corresponds to two discrete colors. By painting with two colors at each value, users can read out the value precisely. This method has many advantages: it requires little image space for visualization; both the overview and details of the dataset are visible in one image without distortion; and implementation is very simple. Several application examples, such as meteorological observation data and train convenience evaluation data, show the effectiveness of the method.</docText>

        <docText>Visualizing coordination in situ

 Exploratory visualization environments allow users to build and browse coordinated multiview visualizations interactively. As the number of views and amount of coordination increases, conceptualizing coordination structure becomes more and more important for successful data exploration. Integrated metavisualization is exploratory visualization of coordination and other interactive structure directly inside a visualization's own user interface. This paper presents a model of integrated metavisualization, describes the problem of capturing dynamic interface structure as visualizable data, and outlines three general approaches to integration. Metavisualization has been implemented in improvise, using views, lenses, and embedding to reveal the dynamic structure of its own highly coordinated visualizations.</docText>

        <docText>An interactive 3D integration of parallel coordinates and star glyphs

 Parallel coordinates are a powerful method for visualizing multidimensional data but, when applied to large data sets, they become cluttered and difficult to read. Star glyphs, on the other hand, can be used to display either the attributes of a data item or the values across all items for a single attribute. Star glyphs may readily provide a quick impression; however, since the full data set require multiple glyphs, overall readings are more difficult. We present parallel glyphs, an interactive integration of the visual representations of parallel coordinates and star glyphs that utilizes the advantages of both representations to offset the disadvantages they have separately. We discuss the role of uniform and stepped colour scales in the visual comparison of non-adjacent items and star glyphs. Parallel glyphs provide capabilities for focus-in-context exploration using two types of lenses and interactions specific to the 3D space.</docText>

        <docText>Multivariate glyphs for multi-object clusters

 Aggregating items can simplify the display of huge quantities of data values at the cost of losing information about the attribute values of the individual items. We propose a distribution glyph, in both two- and three-dimensional forms, which specifically addresses the concept of how the aggregated data is distributed over the possible range of values. It is capable of displaying distribution, variability and extent information for up to four attributes at a time of multivariate, clustered data. User studies validate the concept, showing that both glyphs are just as good as raw data and the 3D glyph is better for answering some questions.</docText>

        <docText>Pixnostics: Towards Measuring the Value of Visualization

During the last two decades a wide variety of advanced methods for the visual exploration of large data sets have been proposed. For most of these techniques user interaction has become a crucial element, since there are many situations in which a user or an analyst has to select the right parameter settings from among many or select a subset of the available attribute space for the visualization process, in order to construct valuable visualizations that provide insight, into the data and reveal interesting patterns. The right choice of input parameters is often essential, since suboptimal parameter settings or the investigation of irrelevant data dimensions make the exploration process more time consuming and may result in wrong conclusions. In this paper we propose a novel method for automatically determining meaningful parameter- and attribute settings based on the information content of the resulting visualizations. Our technique called Pixnostics, in analogy to Scagnostics (Wilkinson et al., 2005), automatically analyses pixel images resulting from diverse parameter mappings and ranks them according to the potential value for the user. This allows a more effective and more efficient visual data analysis process, since the attribute/parameter space is reduced to meaningful selections and thus the analyst obtains faster insight into the data. Real world applications are provided to show the benefit of the proposed approach</docText>

        <docText>Semantic Image Browser: Bridging Information Visualization with Automated Intelligent Image Analysis

Browsing and retrieving images from large image collections are becoming common and important activities. Semantic image analysis techniques, which automatically detect high level semantic contents of images for annotation, are promising solutions toward this problem. However, few efforts have been made to convey the annotation results to users in an intuitive manner to enable effective image browsing and retrieval. There is also a lack of methods to monitor and evaluate the automatic image analysis algorithms due to the high dimensional nature of image data, features, and contents. In this paper, we propose a novel, scalable semantic image browser by applying existing information visualization techniques to semantic image analysis. This browser not only allows users to effectively browse and search in large image databases according to the semantic content of images, but also allows analysts to evaluate their annotation process through interactive visual exploration. The major visualization components of this browser are multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) based image layout, the value and relation (VaR) display that allows effective high dimensional visualization without dimension reduction, and a rich set of interaction tools such as search by sample images and content relationship detection. Our preliminary user study showed that the browser was easy to use and understand, and effective in supporting image browsing and retrieval tasks</docText>

        <docText>Exploratory Visualization of Multivariate Data with Variable Quality

Real-world data is known to be imperfect, suffering from various forms of defects such as sensor variability, estimation errors, uncertainty, human errors in data entry, and gaps in data gathering. Analysis conducted on variable quality data can lead to inaccurate or incorrect results. An effective visualization system must make users aware of the quality of their data by explicitly conveying not only the actual data content, but also its quality attributes. While some research has been conducted on visualizing uncertainty in spatio-temporal data and univariate data, little work has been reported on extending this capability into multivariate data visualization. In this paper we describe our approach to the problem of visually exploring multivariate data with variable quality. As a foundation, we propose a general approach to defining quality measures for tabular data, in which data may experience quality problems at three granularities: individual data values, complete records, and specific dimensions. We then present two approaches to visual mapping of quality information into display space. In particular, one solution embeds the quality measures as explicit values into the original dataset by regarding value quality and record quality as new data dimensions. The other solution is to superimpose the quality information within the data visualizations using additional visual variables. We also report on user studies conducted to assess alternate mappings of quality attributes to visual variables for the second method. In addition, we describe case studies that expose some of the advantages and disadvantages of these two approaches</docText>

        <docText>User Interfaces for the Exploration of Hierarchical Multi-dimensional Data

A variety of user interfaces have been developed to support the querying of hierarchical multi-dimensional data in an OLAP setting such as pivot tables and Polaris. They are used to regularly check portions of a dataset and to explore a new dataset for the first time. In this paper, we establish criteria for OLAP user interface capabilities to facilitate comparison. Two criteria are the number of displayed dimensions along which comparisons can be made and the number of dimensions that are viewable at once - visual comparison depth and width. We argue that interfaces with greater visual comparison depth support regular checking of known data by users that know roughly where to look, while interfaces with greater comparison width support exploration of new data by users that have no a priori starting point and need to scan all dimensions. Pivot tables and Polaris are examples of the former. The main contribution of this paper is to introduce a new scalable interface that uses parallel dimension axis which supports the latter, greater visual comparison width. We compare our approach to both table based and parallel coordinate based interfaces. We present an implementation of our interface SGViewer, user scenarios and provide an evaluation that supports the usability of our interface</docText>

        <docText>A Visual Interface for Multivariate Temporal Data: Finding Patterns of Events across Multiple Histories

Finding patterns of events over time is important in searching patient histories, Web logs, news stories, and criminal activities. This paper presents PatternFinder, an integrated interface for query and result-set visualization for search and discovery of temporal patterns within multivariate and categorical data sets. We define temporal patterns as sequences of events with inter-event time spans. PatternFinder allows users to specify the attributes of events and time spans to produce powerful pattern queries that are difficult to express with other formalisms. We characterize the range of queries PatternFinder supports as users vary the specificity at which events and time spans are defined. Pattern Finder's query capabilities together with coupled ball-and-chain and tabular visualizations enable users to effectively query, explore and analyze event patterns both within and across data entities (e.g. patient histories, terrorist groups, Web logs, etc.)</docText>

        <docText>Scentindex: Conceptually Reorganizing Subject Indexes for Reading

A great deal of analytical work is done in the context of reading, in digesting the semantics of the material, the identification of important entities, and capturing the relationship between entities. Visual analytic environments, therefore, must encompass reading tools that enable the rapid digestion of large amount of reading material. Other than plain text search, subject indexes, and basic highlighting, tools are needed for rapid foraging of text. In this paper, we describe a technique that presents an enhanced subject index for a book by conceptually reorganizing it to suit particular expressed user information needs. Users first enter information needs via keywords describing the concepts they are trying to retrieve and comprehend. Then our system, called ScentIndex, computes what index entries are conceptually related and reorganizes and displays these index entries on a single page. We also provide a number of navigational cues to help users peruse over this list of index entries and find relevant passages quickly. Compared to regular reading of a paper book, our study showed that users are more efficient and more accurate in finding, comparing, and comprehending material in our system</docText>

        <docText>Parallel sets: visual analysis of categorical data

 The discrete nature of categorical data makes it a particular challenge for visualization. Methods that work very well for continuous data are often hardly usable with categorical dimensions. Only few methods deal properly with such data, mostly because of the discrete nature of categorical data, which does not translate well into the continuous domains of space and color. Parallel sets is a new visualization method that adopts the layout of parallel coordinates, but substitutes the individual data points by a frequency based representation. This abstracted view, combined with a set of carefully designed interactions, supports visual data analysis of large and complex data sets. The technique allows efficient work with meta data, which is particularly important when dealing with categorical datasets. By creating new dimensions from existing ones, for example, the user can filter the data according to his or her current needs. We also present the results from an interactive analysis of CRM data using parallel sets. We demonstrate how the flexible layout eases the process of knowledge crystallization, especially when combined with a sophisticated interaction scheme.</docText>

        <docText>Revealing structure within clustered parallel coordinates displays

 In order to gain insight into multivariate data, complex structures must be analysed and understood. Parallel coordinates is an excellent tool for visualizing this type of data but has its limitations. This paper deals with one of its main limitations - how to visualize a large number of data items without hiding the inherent structure they constitute. We solve this problem by constructing clusters and using high precision textures to represent them. We also use transfer functions that operate on the high precision textures in order to highlight different aspects of the cluster characteristics. Providing predefined transfer functions as well as the support to draw customized transfer functions makes it possible to extract different aspects of the data. We also show how feature animation can be used as guidance when simultaneously analysing several clusters. This technique makes it possible to visually represent statistical information about clusters and thus guides the user, making the analysis process more efficient.</docText>

        <docText>Simple 3D glyphs for spatial multivariate data

 We present an effort to evaluate the possible utility of a new type of 3D glyphs intended for visualizations of multivariate spatial data. They are based on results from vision research suggesting that our perception of metric 3D structure is distorted and imprecise relative to the actual scene before us (e.g., "metric 3D structure in visualizations" by M. Lind et al. (2003)); only a class of qualitative properties of the scene is perceived with accuracy. These properties are best characterized as being invariant over affine but not Euclidean transformations. They are related, but not identical to, the non-accidental properties (NAPs) described by Lowe in "perceptual organization and visual recognition" (1984) on which the notion of geons is based in "recognition by components - a theory of image understanding" by I. Biederman (1987). A large number of possible 3D glyphs for the visualization of spatial data can be constructed using such properties. One group is based on the local sign of surface curvature. We investigated these properties in a visualization experiment. The results are promising and the implications for visualization are discussed.</docText>

        <docText>Low-level components of analytic activity in information visualization

 Existing system level taxonomies of visualization tasks are geared more towards the design of particular representations than the facilitation of user analytic activity. We present a set of ten low level analysis tasks that largely capture people's activities while employing information visualization tools for understanding data. To help develop these tasks, we collected nearly 200 sample questions from students about how they would analyze five particular data sets from different domains. The questions, while not being totally comprehensive, illustrated the sheer variety of analytic questions typically posed by users when employing information visualization systems. We hope that the presented set of tasks is useful for information visualization system designers as a kind of common substrate to discuss the relative analytic capabilities of the systems. Further, the tasks may provide a form of checklist for system designers.</docText>

 We present a method for visual summary of bilateral conflict structures embodied in event data. Such data consists of actors linked by time stamped events, and may be extracted from various sources such as news reports and dossiers. When analyzing political events, it is of particular importance to be able to recognize conflicts and actors involved in them. By projecting actors into a conflict space, we are able to highlight the main opponents in a series of tens of thousands of events, and provide a graphic overview of the conflict structure. Moreover, our method allows for smooth animation of the dynamics of a conflict.</docText>

We present a novel visual correlation paradigm for situational awareness (SA) and suggest its usage in a diverse set of applications that require a high level of SA. Our approach is based on a concise and scalable representation, which leads to a flexible visualization tool that is both clear and intuitive to use. Situational awareness is the continuous extraction of environmental information, its integration with previous knowledge to form a coherent mental picture, and the use of that picture in anticipating future events. In this paper we build on our previous work on visualization for network intrusion detection and show how that approach can be generalized to encompass a much broader class of SA systems. We first propose a generalization that is based on what we term, the w3 premise, namely that each event must have at least the what, when and where attributes. We also present a second generalization, which increases flexibility and facilitates complex visual correlations. Finally, we demonstrate the generality of our approaches by applying our visualization paradigm in a collection of diverse SA areas.</docText>

        <docText>Turning the bucket of text into a pipe

 Many visual analysis tools operate on a fixed set of data. However, professional information analysts follow issues over a period of time and need to be able to easily add new documents to an ongoing exploration. Some analysts handle documents in a moving window of time, with new documents constantly added and old ones aging out. This paper describes both the user interaction and the technical implementation approach for a visual analysis system designed to support constantly evolving text collections.</docText>

        <docText>Case study: design and assessment of an enhanced geographic information system for exploration of multivariate health statistics

An implementation of an interactive parallel coordinate plot linked with the ArcView geographic information system (GIS) is presented. The integrated geographic visualization system was created for the exploratory analysis of mortality data from specific cancers as they relate, specifically spatially, to other mortality causes and to demographic and socioeconomic risk factors. The linked and interactive parallel coordinate plot was tested with and compared to a similarly interactive and linked scatterplot in usability assessments designed to assess each representations relative effectiveness for exploration of these data sets. Evidence from these studies suggests that multivariate, spatial, and/or time series exploration is enhanced through the use of the parallel coordinate plot linked to maps</docText>

        <docText>An evaluation of content browsing techniques for hierarchical space-filling visualizations

 Space-filling visualizations, such as the TreeMap, are well suited for displaying the properties of nodes in hierarchies. To browse the contents of the hierarchy, the primary mode of interaction is by drilling down through many successive layers. In this paper we introduce a distortion algorithm based on fisheye and continuous zooming techniques for browsing data in the TreeMap representation. The motivation behind the distortion approach is for assisting users to rapidly browse information displayed in the TreeMap without opening successive layers of the hierarchy. Two experiments were conducted to evaluate the new approach. In the first experiment (N=20) the distortion approach is compared to the drill down method. Results show that subjects are quicker and more accurate in locating targets of interest using the distortion method. The second experiment (N=12) evaluates the effectiveness of the two approaches in a task requiring context, we define as the context browsing task. The results show that subjects are quicker and more accurate in locating targets with the distortion technique in the context browsing task.</docText>

        <docText>Case study: e-commerce clickstream visualization

We have developed an interactive, scalable visualization tool for analyzing the behavior of users of a web site. Our system not only shows site topology and traffic flow, but by segmenting site traffic data based on user attributes, including demographic data and purchase history, we can present a more complete picture of web site usage. This can lead to a more focussed analysis that allows direct comparison between user segments, and ultimately a deeper understanding of how users interact with a site. The tool is designed for real world use, and we present a usage study of the tool by analyzing the data of a failed dot-com.</docText>

        <docText>Dynamic visualization of graphs with extended labels

 The paper describes a novel technique to visualize graphs with extended node and link labels. The lengths of these labels range from a short phrase to a full sentence to an entire paragraph and beyond. Our solution is different from all the existing approaches that almost always rely on intensive computational effort to optimize the label placement problem. Instead, we share the visualization resources with the graph and present the label information in static, interactive, and dynamic modes without the requirement for tackling the intractability issues. This allows us to reallocate the computational resources for dynamic presentation of real time information. The paper includes a user study to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of the visualization technique.</docText>

        <docText>Case study: visualization for decision tree analysis in data mining

Decision trees are one of the most popular methods of data mining. Decision trees partition large amounts of data into smaller segments by applying a series of rules. Creating and evaluating decision trees benefits greatly from visualization of the trees and diagnostic measures of their effectiveness. This paper describes an application, EMTree Results Viewer, that supports decision tree analysis through the visualization of model results and diagnosis. The functionality of the application and the visualization techniques are revealed through an example of churn analysis in the telecommunications industry.</docText>

        <docText>Dig-CoLa: directed graph layout through constrained energy minimization

 We describe a new method for visualization of directed graphs. The method combines constraint programming techniques with a high performance force directed placement (FDP) algorithm so that the directed nature of the graph is highlighted while useful properties of FDP - such as emphasis of symmetries and preservation of proximity relations - are retained. Our algorithm automatically identifies those parts of the digraph that contain hierarchical information and draws them accordingly. Additionally, those parts that do not contain hierarchy are drawn at the same quality expected from a nonhierarchical, undirected layout algorithm. An interesting application of our algorithm is directional multidimensional scaling (DMDS). DMDS deals with low dimensional embedding of multivariate data where we want to emphasize the overall flow in the data (e.g. chronological progress) along one of the axes.</docText>

        <docText>2D vs 3D, implications on spatial memory

Since the introduction of graphical user interfaces (GUI) and two-dimensional (2D ) displays, the concept of space has entered the information technology (IT) domain. Interactions with computers were re-encoded in terms of fidelity to the interactions with real environment and consequently in terms of fitness to cognitive and spatial abilities. A further step in this direction was the creation of three-dimensional (3D) displays which have amplified the fidelity of digital representations. However, there are no systematic results evaluating the extent to which 3D displays better support cognitive spatial abilities. The aim of this research is to empirically investigate spatial memory performance across different instances of 2D and 3D displays. Two experiments were performed. The displays used in the experimental situation represented hierarchical information structures. The results of the test show that the 3D display does improve performances in the designed spatial memory task.</docText>

        <docText>Beyond Usability: Evaluation Aspects of Visual Analytic Environments

A new field of research, visual analytics, has been introduced. This has been defined as "the science of analytical reasoning facilitated by interactive visual interfaces" (Thomas and Cook, 2005). Visual analytic environments, therefore, support analytical reasoning using visual representations and interactions, with data representations and transformation capabilities, to support production, presentation, and dissemination. As researchers begin to develop visual analytic environments, it is advantageous to develop metrics and methodologies to help researchers measure the progress of their work and understand the impact their work has on the users who work in such environments. This paper presents five areas or aspects of visual analytic environments that should be considered as metrics and methodologies for evaluation are developed. Evaluation aspects need to include usability, but it is necessary to go beyond basic usability. The areas of situation awareness, collaboration, interaction, creativity, and utility are proposed as the five evaluation areas for initial consideration. The steps that need to be undertaken to develop systematic evaluation methodologies and metrics for visual analytic environments are outlined</docText>

We introduce a visual analytics environment for the support of remote-collaborative sense-making activities. Team members use their individual graphical interfaces to collect, organize and comprehend task-relevant information relative to their areas of expertise. A system of computational agents infers possible relationships among information items through the analysis of the spatial and temporal organization and collaborative use of information. The computational agents support the exchange of information among team members to converge their individual contributions. Our system allows users to navigate vast amounts of shared information effectively and remotely dispersed team members to work independently without diverting from common objectives as well as to minimize the necessary amount of verbal communication</docText>

        <docText>Toward a Multi-Analyst, Collaborative Framework for Visual Analytics

We describe a framework for the display of complex, multidimensional data, designed to facilitate exploration, analysis, and collaboration among multiple analysts. This framework aims to support human collaboration by making it easier to share representations, to translate from one point of view to another, to explain arguments, to update conclusions when underlying assumptions change, and to justify or account for decisions or actions. Multidimensional visualization techniques are used with interactive, context-sensitive, and tunable graphs. Visual representations are flexibly generated using a knowledge representation scheme based on annotated logic; this enables not only tracking and fusing different viewpoints, but also unpacking them. Fusing representations supports the creation of multidimensional meta-displays as well as the translation or mapping from one point of view to another. At the same time, analysts also need to be able to unpack one another's complex chains of reasoning, especially if they have reached different conclusions, and to determine the implications, if any, when underlying assumptions or evidence turn out to be false. The framework enables us to support a variety of scenarios as well as to systematically generate and test experimental hypotheses about the impact of different kinds of visual representations upon interactive collaboration by teams of distributed analysts</docText>

        <docText>Monitoring Network Traffic with Radial Traffic Analyzer

Extensive spread of malicious code on the Internet and also within intranets has risen the user's concern about what kind of data is transferred between her or his computer and other hosts on the network. Visual analysis of this kind of information is a challenging task, due to the complexity and volume of the data type considered, and requires special design of appropriate visualization techniques. In this paper, we present a scalable visualization toolkit for analyzing network activity of computer hosts on a network. The visualization combines network packet volume and type distribution information with geographic information, enabling the analyst to use geographic distortion techniques such as the HistoMap technique to become aware of the traffic components in the course of the analysis. The presented analysis tool is especially useful to compare important network load characteristics in a geographically aware display, to relate communication partners, and to identify the type of network traffic occurring. The results of the analysis are helpful in understanding typical network communication activities, and in anticipating potential performance bottlenecks or problems. It is suited for both off-line analysis of historic data, and via animation for on-line monitoring of packet-based network traffic in real time</docText>

        <docText>Accelerating Network Traffic Analytics Using Query-Driven Visualization

Realizing operational analytics solutions where large and complex data must be analyzed in a time-critical fashion entails integrating many different types of technology. This paper focuses on an interdisciplinary combination of scientific data management and visualization/analysis technologies targeted at reducing the time required for data filtering, querying, hypothesis testing and knowledge discovery in the domain of network connection data analysis. We show that use of compressed bitmap indexing can quickly answer queries in an interactive visual data analysis application, and compare its performance with two alternatives for serial and parallel filtering/querying on 2.5 billion records' worth of network connection data collected over a period of 42 weeks. Our approach to visual network connection data exploration centers on two primary factors: interactive ad-hoc and multiresolution query formulation and execution over n dimensions and visual display of the n-dimensional histogram results. This combination is applied in a case study to detect a distributed network scan and to then identify the set of remote hosts participating in the attack. Our approach is sufficiently general to be applied to a diverse set of data understanding problems as well as used in conjunction with a diverse set of analysis and visualization tools</docText>

This paper presents a network traffic analysis system that couples visual analysis with a declarative knowledge representation. The system supports multiple iterations of the sense-making loop of analytic reasoning by allowing users to save discoveries as they are found and to reuse them in future iterations. We show how the knowledge representation can be used to improve both the visual representations and the basic analytical tasks of filtering and changing level of detail. We describe how the system can be used to produce models of network patterns, and show results from classifying one day of network traffic in our laboratory</docText>

        <docText>Interactive Wormhole Detection in Large Scale Wireless Networks

Wormhole attacks in wireless networks can severely deteriorate the network performance and compromise the security through spoiling the routing protocols and weakening the security enhancements. This paper develops an approach, interactive visualization of wormholes (IVoW), to monitor and detect such attacks in large scale wireless networks in real time. We characterize the topology features of a network under wormhole attacks through the node position changes and visualize the information at dynamically adjusted scales. We integrate an automatic detection algorithm with appropriate user interactions to handle complicated scenarios that include a large number of moving nodes and multiple worm-hole attackers. Various visual forms have been adopted to assist the understanding and analysis of the reconstructed network topology and improve the detection accuracy. Extended simulation has demonstrated that the proposed approach can effectively locate the fake neighbor connections without introducing many false alarms. IVoW does not require the wireless nodes to be equipped with any special hardware, thus avoiding any additional cost. The proposed approach demonstrates that interactive visualization can be successfully combined with network security mechanisms to greatly improve the intrusion detection capabilities</docText>

        <docText>NetLens: Iterative Exploration of Content-Actor Network Data

Networks have remained a challenge for information retrieval and visualization because of the rich set of tasks that users want to accomplish. This paper offers an abstract content-actor network data model, a classification of tasks, and a tool to support them. The NetLens interface was designed around the abstract content-actor network data model to allow users to pose a series of elementary queries and iteratively refine visual overviews and sorted lists. This enables the support of complex queries that are traditionally hard to specify. NetLens is general and scalable in that it applies to any dataset that can be represented with our abstract data model. This paper describes NetLens applying a subset of the ACM Digital Library consisting of about 4,000 papers from the CM I conference written by about 6,000 authors. In addition, we are now working on a collection of half a million emails, and a dataset of legal cases</docText>

        <docText>Interactive Visualization and Analysis of Network and Sensor Data on Mobile Devices

Mobile devices are rapidly gaining popularity due to their small size and their wide range of functionality. With the constant improvement in wireless network access, they are an attractive option not only for day to day use. but also for in-field analytics by first responders in widespread areas. However, their limited processing, display, graphics and power resources pose a major challenge in developing effective applications. Nevertheless, they are vital for rapid decision making in emergencies when combined with appropriate analysis tools. In this paper, we present an efficient, interactive visual analytic system using a PDA to visualize network information from Purdue's Ross-Ade Stadium during football games as an example of in-held data analytics combined with text and video analysis. With our system, we can monitor the distribution of attendees with mobile devices throughout the stadium through their access of information and association/disassociation from wireless access points, enabling the detection of crowd movement and event activity. Through correlative visualization and analysis of synchronized video (instant replay video) and text information (play statistics) with the network activity, we can provide insightful information to network monitoring personnel, safety personnel and analysts. This work provides a demonstration and testbed for mobile sensor analytics that will help to improve network performance and provide safety personnel with information for better emergency planning and guidance</docText>

        <docText>Exploring Large-Scale Video News via Interactive Visualization

In this paper, we have developed a novel visualization framework to enable more effective visual analysis of large-scale news videos, where keyframes and keywords are automatically extracted from news video clips and visually represented according to their interestingness measurement to help audiences rind news stories of interest at first glance. A computational approach is also developed to quantify the interestingness measurement of video clips. Our experimental results have shown that our techniques for intelligent news video analysis have the capacity to enable more effective visualization of large-scale news videos. Our news video visualization system is very useful for security applications and for general audiences to quickly find news topics of interest from among many channels</docText>

        <docText>Elastic hierarchies: combining treemaps and node-link diagrams

 We investigate the use of elastic hierarchies for representing trees, where a single graphical depiction uses a hybrid mixture, or "interleaving", of more basic forms at different nodes of the tree. In particular, we explore combinations of node link and treemap forms, to combine the space efficiency of treemaps with the structural clarity of node link diagrams. A taxonomy is developed to characterize the design space of such hybrid combinations. A software prototype is described, which we used to explore various techniques for visualizing, browsing and interacting with elastic hierarchies, such as side by side overview and detail views, highlighting and rubber banding across views, visualization of multiple foci, and smooth animations across transitions. The paper concludes with a discussion of the characteristics of elastic hierarchies and suggestions for research on their properties and uses.</docText>

        <docText>Voronoi treemaps

 Treemaps are a well known method for the visualization of attributed hierarchical data. Previously proposed treemap layout algorithms are limited to rectangular shapes, which cause problems with the aspect ratio of the rectangles as well as with identifying the visualized hierarchical structure. The approach of Voronoi treemaps presented in this paper eliminates these problems through enabling subdivisions of and in polygons. Additionally, this allows for creating treemap visualizations within areas of arbitrary shape, such as triangles and circles, thereby enabling a more flexible adaptation of treemaps for a wider range of applications.</docText>

        <docText>An empirical comparison of three commercial information visualization systems

An empirical comparison of three commercial information visualization systems on three different databases is presented. The systems use different paradigms for visualizing data. Tasks were selected to be "ecologically relevant", i.e. meaningful and interesting in the respective domains. Users of one system turned out to solve problems significantly faster than users of the other two, while users of another system would supply significantly more correct answers. Reasons for these results and general observations about the studied systems are discussed.</docText>

        <docText>PRISAD: a partitioned rendering infrastructure for scalable accordion drawing

 We present PRISAD, the first generic rendering infrastructure for information visualization applications that use the accordion drawing technique: rubber sheet navigation with guaranteed visibility for marked areas of interest. Our new rendering algorithms are based on the partitioning of screen space, which allows us to handle dense dataset regions correctly. The algorithms in previous work led to incorrect visual representations because of overculling, and to inefficiencies due to overdrawing multiple items in the same region. Our pixel based drawing infrastructure guarantees correctness by eliminating overculling, and improves rendering performance with tight bounds on overdrawing. PRITree and PRISeq are applications built on PRISAD, with the feature sets of TreeJuxtaposer and SequenceJuxtaposer, respectively. We describe our PRITree and PRISeq dataset traversal algorithms, which are used for efficient rendering, culling, and layout of datasets within the PRISAD framework. We also discuss PRITree node marking techniques, which offer order-of-magnitude improvements to both memory and time performance versus previous range storage and retrieval techniques. Our PRITree implementation features a five fold increase in rendering speed for nontrivial tree structures, and also reduces memory requirements in some real world datasets by up to eight times, so we are able to handle trees of several million nodes. PRISeq renders fifteen times faster and handles datasets twenty times larger than previous work.</docText>

        <docText>Pixel bar charts: a new technique for visualizing large multi-attribute data sets without aggregation

Simple presentation graphics are intuitive and easy-to-use, but show only highly aggregated data and present only a very limited number of data values (as in the case of bar charts). In addition, these graphics may have a high degree of overlap which may occlude a significant portion of the data values (as in the case of the x-y plots). In this paper, we therefore propose a generalization of traditional bar charts and x-y-plots which allows the visualization of large amounts of data. The basic idea is to use the pixels within the bars to present the detailed information of the data records. Our so-called pixel bar charts retain the intuitiveness of traditional bar charts while allowing very large data sets to be visualized in an effective way. We show that, for an effective pixel placement, we have to solve complex optimization problems, and present an algorithm which efficiently solves the problem. Our application using real-world e-commerce data shows the wide applicability and usefulness of our new idea.</docText>

        <docText>Vizster: visualizing online social networks

Recent years have witnessed the dramatic popularity of online social networking services, in which millions of members publicly articulate mutual "friendship" relations. Guided by ethnographic research of these online communities, we have designed and implemented a visualization system for playful end-user exploration and navigation of large scale online social networks. Our design builds upon familiar node link network layouts to contribute customized techniques for exploring connectivity in large graph structures, supporting visual search and analysis, and automatically identifying and visualizing community structures. Both public installation and controlled studies of the system provide evidence of the system's usability, capacity for facilitating discovery, and potential for fun and engaged social activity</docText>

        <docText>The visual code navigator: an interactive toolset for source code investigation

We present the Visual Code Navigator, a set of three interrelated visual tools that we developed for exploring large source code software projects from three different perspectives, or views: the syntactic view shows the syntactic constructs in the source code. The symbol view shows the objects a file makes available after compilation, such as function signatures, variables, and namespaces. The evolution view looks at different versions in a project lifetime of a number of selected source files. The views share one code model, which combines hierarchical syntax based and line based information from multiple source files versions. We render this code model using a visual model that extends the pixel-filling, space partitioning properties of shaded cushion treemaps with novel techniques. We discuss how our views allow users to interactively answer complex questions on various code elements by simple mouse clicks. We validate the efficiency and effectiveness of our toolset by an informal user study on the source code of VTK, a large, industry-size C++ code base</docText>

        <docText>Semantic depth of field

We present a new technique called Semantic Depth of Field (SDOF) as an alternative approach to focus-andcontext displays of information. We utilize a well-known method from photography and cinematography (depth-offield effect) for information visualization, which is to blur different parts of the depicted scene in dependence of their relevance. Independent of their spatial locations, objects of interest are depicted sharply in SDOF, whereas the context of the visualization is blurred. In this paper, we present a flexible model of SDOF which can be easily adopted to various types of applications. We discuss pros and cons of the new technique, give examples of application, and describe a fast prototype implementation of SDOF.</docText>

The general problem of visualizing "family trees", or genealogical graphs, in 2D, is considered. A graph theoretic analysis is given, which identifies why genealogical graphs can be difficult to draw. This motivates some novel graphical representations, including one based on a dual tree, a subgraph formed by the union of two trees. Dual trees can be drawn in various styles, including an indented outline style, and allow users to browse general multitrees in addition to genealogical graphs, by transitioning between different dual tree views. A software prototype for such browsing is described, that supports smoothly animated transitions, automatic camera framing, rotation of subtrees, and a novel interaction technique for expanding or collapsing subtrees to any depth with a single mouse drag</docText>

        <docText>Botanical visualization of huge hierarchies

A new method for the visualization of huge hierarchical data structures is presented. The method is based on the observation that we can easily see the branches, leaves, and their arrangement in a botanical tree, despite of the large number of elements. The strand model of Holton is used to convert an abstract tree into a geometric model. Nonleaf nodes are mapped to branches and child nodes to subbranches. A naive application of this model leads to unsatisfactory results, hence it is tailored to suit our purposes better. Continuing branches are emphasized, long branches are contracted, and sets of leaves are shown as fruit. The method is applied to the visualization of directory structures. The elements, directories and files, as well as their relations can easily be extracted, thereby showing that the use of methods from botanical modeling can be effective for information visualization.</docText>

        <docText>A sky dome visualisation for identification of astronomical orientations

It has long been known that ancient temples were frequently oriented along the cardinal directions or to certain points along the horizon where Sun or Moon rise or set on special days of the year. In the last decades, archaeologists have found evidence of even older building structures buried in the soil, with doorways that also appear to have distinct orientations. This paper presents a novel diagram combining archaeological maps with a folded-apart, flattened view of the whole sky, showing the local horizon and the daily paths of Sun, Moon and brighter stars. By use of this diagram, interesting groupings of astronomical orientation directions, e.g. to certain Sunrise and Sunset points could be identified, which were evidently used to mark certain days of the year. Orientations to a few significant stars very likely indicated the beginning of the agricultural year in the middle neolithic period</docText>

        <docText>Collapsible cylindrical trees: a fast hierarchical navigation technique

This paper proposes a new visualization and interaction technique for medium-sized trees, called Collapsible Cylindrical Trees (CCT). Child nodes are mapped on rotating cylinders, which will be dynamically displayed or hidden to achieve a useful balance of detail and context. Besides a comprehensible threedimensional visualization of trees, the main feature of CCT is a very fast and intuitive interaction with the displayed nodes. Only a single click is needed to reach every node and perform an action on it, such as displaying a web page. The CCT browsing technique was developed for interaction with web hierarchies but is not limited to this domain. We also present sample implementations of CCT using VRML, which show the usefulness of this intuitive tree navigation technique.</docText>

The Name Voyager, a Web based visualization of historical trends in baby naming, has proven remarkably popular. This paper discusses the interaction techniques it uses for smooth visual exploration of thousands of time series. We also describe design decisions behind the application and lessons learned in creating an application that makes do-it-yourself data mining popular. The prime lesson, it is hypothesized, is that an information visualization tool may be fruitfully viewed not as a tool but as part of an online social environment. In other words, to design a successful exploratory data analysis tool, one good strategy is to create a system that enables "social" data analysis</docText>

        <docText>Ordered treemap layouts

Treemaps, a space-filling method of visualizing large hierarchical data sets, are receiving increasing attention. Several algorithms have been proposed to create more useful displays by controlling the aspect ratios of the rectangles that make up a treemap. While these algorithms do improve visibility of small items in a single layout, they introduce instability over time in the display of dynamically changing data, and fail to preserve an ordering of the underlying data. This paper introduces the ordered treemap, which addresses these two shortcomings. The ordered treemap algorithm ensures that items near each other in the given order will be near each other in the treemap layout. Using experimental evidence from Monte Carlo trials, we show that compared to other layout algorithms ordered treemaps are more stable while maintaining relatively favorable aspect ratios of the constituent rectangles. A second test set uses stock market data.</docText>

        <docText>Graph sketches

We introduce the notion of Graph Sketches. They can be thought of as visual indices that guide the navigation of a multi-graph too large to fit on the available display. We adhere to the Visual Information-Seeking Mantra: Overview first, zoom and filter, then details on demand. Graph Sketches are incorporated into MGV, an integrated visualization and exploration system for massive multi-digraph navigation. We highlight the main algorithmic and visualization tasks behind the computation of Graph Sketches and illustrate several application scenarios. Graph Sketches will be used to guide the navigation of multi-digraphs defined on vertex sets with sizes ranging from 100 to 250 million vertices.</docText>

        <docText>Visualization of state transition graphs

A new method for the visualization of state transition graphs is presented. Visual information is reduced by clustering nodes, forming a tree structure of related clusters. This structure is visualized in three dimensions with concepts from cone trees and emphasis on symmetry. The resulting visualization makes it easier to relate features in the visualization of the state transition graph to semantic concepts in the corresponding process and vice versa.</docText>

A semantic graph is a network of heterogeneous nodes and links annotated with a domain ontology. In intelligence analysis, investigators use semantic graphs to organize concepts and relationships as graph nodes and links in hopes of discovering key trends, patterns, and insights. However, as new information continues to arrive from a multitude of sources, the size and complexity of the semantic graphs will soon overwhelm an investigator's cognitive capacity to carry out significant analyses. We introduce a powerful visual analytics framework designed to enhance investigators' natural analytical capabilities to comprehend and analyze large semantic graphs. The paper describes the overall framework design, presents major development accomplishments to date, and discusses future directions of a new visual analytics system known as Have Green</docText>

        <docText>Effective graph visualization via node grouping

We discuss four methodologies for the application of node grouping in graph visualization. In addition, we introduce techniques for force-directed and orthogonal drawing which use node grouping information and have been shown in experiments to perform better than previous techniques. Not only do these techniques have significantly improved performance with respect to standard aesthetic measures, but they also attain qualitative improvement. </docText>

        <docText>Visual Analysis of Conflicting Opinions

Understanding the nature and dynamics of conflicting opinions is a profound and challenging issue. In this paper we address several aspects of the issue through a study of more than 3,000 Amazon customer reviews of the controversial bestseller The Da Vinci Code, including 1,738 positive and 918 negative reviews. The study is motivated by critical questions such as: what are the differences between positive and negative reviews? What is the origin of a particular opinion? How do these opinions change over time? To what extent can differentiating features be identified from unstructured text? How accurately can these features predict the category of a review? We first analyze terminology variations in these reviews in terms of syntactic, semantic, and statistic associations identified by TermWatch and use term variation patterns to depict underlying topics. We then select the most predictive terms based on log likelihood tests and demonstrate that this small set of terms classifies over 70% of the conflicting reviews correctly. This feature selection process reduces the dimensionality of the feature space from more than 20,000 dimensions to a couple of hundreds. We utilize automatically generated decision trees to facilitate the understanding of conflicting opinions in terms of these highly predictive terms. This study also uses a number of visualization and modeling tools to identify not only what positive and negative reviews have in common, but also they differ and evolve over time</docText>

        <docText>Interactive Visual Synthesis of Analytic Knowledge

A visual investigation involves both the examination of existing information and the synthesis of new analytic knowledge. This is a progressive process in which newly synthesized knowledge becomes the foundation for future discovery. In this paper, we present a novel system supporting interactive, progressive synthesis of analytic knowledge. Here we use the term "analytic knowledge" to refer to concepts that a user derives from existing data along with the evidence supporting such concepts. Unlike existing visual analytic-tools, which typically support only exploration of existing information, our system offers two unique features. First, we support user-system cooperative visual synthesis of analytic knowledge from existing data. Specifically, users can visually define new concepts by annotating existing information, and refine partially formed concepts by linking additional evidence or manipulating related concepts. In response to user actions, our system can automatically manage the evolving corpus of synthesized knowledge and its corresponding evidence. Second, we support progressive visual analysis of synthesized knowledge. This feature allows analysts to visually explore both existing knowledge and synthesized knowledge, dynamically incorporating earlier analytic conclusions into the ensuing discovery process. We have applied our system to two complex but very different analytic applications. Our preliminary evaluation shows the promise of our work</docText>

        <docText>D-Dupe: An Interactive Tool for Entity Resolution in Social Networks

Visualizing and analyzing social networks is a challenging problem that has been receiving growing attention. An important first step, before analysis can begin, is ensuring that the data is accurate. A common data quality problem is that the data may inadvertently contain several distinct references to the same underlying entity; the process of reconciling these references is called entity-resolution. D-Dupe is an interactive tool that combines data mining algorithms for entity resolution with a task-specific network visualization. Users cope with complexity of cleaning large networks by focusing on a small subnetwork containing a potential duplicate pair. The subnetwork highlights relationships in the social network, making the common relationships easy to visually identify. D-Dupe users resolve ambiguities either by merging nodes or by marking them distinct. The entity resolution process is iterative: as pairs of nodes are resolved, additional duplicates may be revealed; therefore, resolution decisions are often chained together. We give examples of how users can flexibly apply sequences of actions to produce a high quality entity resolution result. We illustrate and evaluate the benefits of D-Dupe on three bibliographic collections. Two of the datasets had already been cleaned, and therefore should not have contained duplicates; despite this fact, many duplicates were rapidly identified using D-Dupe's unique combination of entity resolution algorithms within a task-specific visual interface</docText>

        <docText>Visual Analysis of Historic Hotel Visitation Patterns

Understanding the space and time characteristics of human interaction in complex social networks is a critical component of visual tools for intelligence analysis, consumer behavior analysis, and human geography. Visual identification and comparison of patterns of recurring events is an essential feature of such tools. In this paper, we describe a tool for exploring hotel visitation patterns in and around Rebersburg, Pennsylvania from 1898-1900. The tool uses a wrapping spreadsheet technique, called reruns, to display cyclic patterns of geographic events in multiple overlapping natural and artificial calendars. Implemented as an improvise visualization, the tool is in active development through a iterative process of data collection, hypothesis, design, discovery, and evaluation in close collaboration with historical geographers. Several discoveries have inspired ongoing data collection and plans to expand exploration to include historic weather records and railroad schedules. Distributed online evaluations of usability and usefulness have resulted in numerous feature and design recommendations</docText>

        <docText>Avian Flu Case Study with nSpace and GeoTime

GeoTime and nSpace are new analysis tools that provide innovative visual analytic capabilities. This paper uses an epidemiology analysis scenario to illustrate and discuss these new investigative methods and techniques. In addition, this case study is an exploration and demonstration of the analytical synergy achieved by combining GeoTime's geo-temporal analysis capabilities, with the rapid information triage, scanning and sense-making provided by nSpace. A fictional analyst works through the scenario from the initial brainstorming through to a final collaboration and report. With the efficient knowledge acquisition and insights into large amounts of documents, there is more time for the analyst to reason about the problem and imagine ways to mitigate threats. The use of both nSpace and GeoTime initiated a synergistic exchange of ideas, where hypotheses generated in either software tool could be cross-referenced, refuted, and supported by the other tool</docText>

        <docText>Visual Analytics of Paleoceanographic Conditions

Decade scale oceanic phenomena like El Nino are correlated with weather anomalies all over the globe. Only by understanding the events that produced the climatic conditions in the past will it be possible to forecast abrupt climate changes and prevent disastrous consequences for human beings and their environment. Paleoceanography research is a collaborative effort that requires the analysis of paleo time-series, which are obtained from a number of independent techniques and instruments and produced by a variety of different researchers and/or laboratories. The complexity of these phenomena that consist of massive, dynamic and often conflicting data can only be faced by means of analytical reasoning supported by a highly interactive visual interface. This paper presents an interactive visual analysis environment for paleoceanography that permits to gain insight into the paleodata and allow the control and steering of the analytical methods involved in the reconstruction of the climatic conditions of the past</docText>

        <docText>Visual Exploration of Spatio-temporal Relationships for Scientific Data

Spatio-temporal relationships among features extracted from temporally-varying scientific datasets can provide useful information about the evolution of an individual feature and its interactions with other features. However, extracting such useful relationships without user guidance is cumbersome and often an error prone process. In this paper, we present a visual analysis system that interactively discovers such relationships from the trajectories of derived features. We describe analysis algorithms to derive various spatial and spatio-temporal relationships. A visual interface is presented using which the user can interactively select spatial and temporal extents to guide the knowledge discovery process. We show the usefulness of our proposed algorithms on datasets originating from computational fluid dynamics. We also demonstrate how the derived relationships can help in explaining the occurrence of critical events like merging and bifurcation of the vortices</docText>

        <docText>Time Tree: Exploring Time Changing Hierarchies

Intelligence analysis often involves the task of gathering information about an organization. Knowledge about individuals in an organization and their relationships, often represented as a hierarchical organization chart, is crucial for understanding the organization. However, it is difficult for intelligence analysts to follow all individuals in an organization. Existing hierarchy visualizations have largely focused on the visualization of fixed structures and can not effectively depict the evolution of a hierarchy over time. We introduce TimeTree, a novel visualization tool designed to enable exploration of a changing hierarchy. TimeTree enables analysts to navigate the history of an organization, identify events associated with a specific entity (visualized on a TimeSlider), and explore an aggregate view of an individual's career path (a CareerTree). We demonstrate the utility of TimeTree by investigating a set of scenarios developed by an expert intelligence analyst. The scenarios are evaluated using a real dataset composed of eighteen thousand career events from more than eight thousand individuals. Insights gained from this analysis are presented</docText>

        <docText>Animated exploration of dynamic graphs with radial layout

We describe a new animation technique for supporting interactive exploration of a graph. We use the wellknown radial tree layout method, in which the view is determined by the selection of a focus node. Our main contribution is a method for animating the transition to a new layout when a new focus node is selected. In order to keep the transition easy to follow, the animation linearly interpolates the polar coordinates of the nodes, while enforcing ordering and orientation constraints. We apply this technique to visualizations of social networks and of the Gnutella file-sharing network, and discuss the results from our informal usability tests.</docText>

        <docText>Technical note: visually encoding program test information to find faults in software

Large test suites are frequently used to evaluate software systems and to locate errors. Unfortunately, this process can generate a huge amount of data that is difficult to interpret manually. We have created a system, TARANTULA, that visually encodes test data to help find program errors. The system uses a principled color mapping to represent how source lines act in passed and failed tests. It also provides a flexible user interface for examining different perspectives that show the behavior of the source code on test sets, ranging from individual tests, to important subsets such as the set of failed tests, to the entire test suite.</docText>

        <docText>Cluster stability and the use of noise in interpretation of clustering

A clustering and ordination algorithm suitable for mining extremely large databases, including those produced by microarray expression studies, is described and analyzed for stability. Data from a yeast cell cycle experiment with 6000 genes and 18 experimental measurements per gene are used to test this algorithm under practical conditions. The process of assigning database objects to an X,Y coordinate, ordination, is shown to be stable with respect to random starting conditions, and with respect to minor perturbations in the starting similarity estimates. Careful analysis of the way clusters typically co-locate, versus the occasional large displacements under different starting conditions are shown to be useful in interpreting the data. This extra stability information is lost when only a single cluster is reported, which is currently the accepted practice. However, it is believed that the approaches presented here should become a standard part of best practices in analyzing computer clustering of large data collections.</docText>

Change blindness occurs when people do not notice changes in visible elements of a scene. If people use an information visualization system to compare document collection subsets partitioned by their time-stamps, change blindness makes it impossible for them to recognize even very major changes, let alone minor ones. We describe theories from cognitive science that account for the change blindness phenomenon, as well as solutions developed for two visual analysis tools, a dot plot ( SPIRE Galaxies) and landscape (ThemeView) visualizations.</docText>

        <docText>Visualizing time-series on spirals

In this paper, we present a new approach for the visualization of time-series data based on spirals. Different to classical bar charts and line graphs, the spiral is suited to visualize large data sets and supports much better the identification of periodic structures in the data. Moreover, it supports both the visualization of nominal and quantitative data based on a similar visualization metaphor. The extension of the spiral visualization to 3D gives access to concepts for zooming and focusing and linking in the data set. As such, spirals complement other visualization techniques for time series and specifically enhance the identication of periodic patterns.</docText>

        <docText>To draw a tree

The quintessential goal of information visualization is depicting abstractions and relations for non-spatial data. A hierarchy is a particularly expressive abstraction that can be applied to a broad range of domains: the genealogical lineages of human descent, the functional decomposition of complex mechanical objects, the classification of knowledge, the evolutionary relationships between species. All of these hierarchical relationships are representable through the abstraction of a recursively defined tree. For this reason, trees occupy a place along with arrays, lists and graphs as one of the most important data structures in computer science. Considering the simple problem of how to effectively draw a tree uncovers many issues fundamental to information visualization. Different drawing styles emphasize different properties of trees, often in subtle ways. I will discuss how people think about trees, and thus what kinds of relationships a tree drawing can usefully convey. My discussion will include a review of many methods for drawing trees, including both historical examples from the sciences and techniques recently developed by researchers in information visualization.</docText>

        <docText>Software Design Patterns for Information Visualization

Despite a diversity of software architectures supporting information visualization, it is often difficult to identify, evaluate, and re-apply the design solutions implemented within such frameworks. One popular and effective approach for addressing such difficulties is to capture successful solutions in design patterns, abstract descriptions of interacting software components that can be customized to solve design problems within a particular context. Based upon a review of existing frameworks and our own experiences building visualization software, we present a series of design patterns for the domain of information visualization. We discuss the structure, context of use, and interrelations of patterns spanning data representation, graphics, and interaction. By representing design knowledge in a reusable form, these patterns can be used to facilitate software design, implementation, and evaluation, and improve developer education and communication</docText>

        <docText>Complex Logarithmic Views for Small Details in Large Contexts

Commonly known detail in context techniques for the two-dimensional Euclidean space enlarge details and shrink their context using mapping functions that introduce geometrical compression. This makes it difficult or even impossible to recognize shapes for large differences in magnification factors. In this paper we propose to use the complex logarithm and the complex root functions to show very small details even in very large contexts. These mappings are conformal, which means they only locally rotate and scale, thus keeping shapes intact and recognizable. They allow showing details that are orders of magnitude smaller than their surroundings in combination with their context in one seamless visualization. We address the utilization of this universal technique for the interaction with complex two-dimensional data considering the exploration of large graphs and other examples</docText>

        <docText>The Perceptual Scalability of Visualization

Larger, higher resolution displays can be used to increase the scalability of information visualizations. But just how much can scalability increase using larger displays before hitting human perceptual or cognitive limits? Are the same visualization techniques that are good on a single monitor also the techniques that are best when they are scaled up using large, high-resolution displays? To answer these questions we performed a controlled experiment on user performance time, accuracy, and subjective workload when scaling up data quantity with different space-time-attribute visualizations using a large, tiled display. Twelve college students used small multiples, embedded bar matrices, and embedded time-series graphs either on a 2 megapixel (Mp) display or with data scaled up using a 32 Mp tiled display. Participants performed various overview and detail tasks on geospatially-referenced multidimensional time-series data. Results showed that current designs are perceptually scalable because they result in a decrease in task completion time when normalized per number of data attributes along with no decrease in accuracy. It appears that, for the visualizations selected for this study, the relative comparison between designs is generally consistent between display sizes. However, results also suggest that encoding is more important on a smaller display while spatial grouping is more important on a larger display. Some suggestions for designers are provided based on our experience designing visualizations for large displays.</docText>

        <docText>IPSep-CoLa: An Incremental Procedure for Separation Constraint Layout of Graphs

Existing information-visualization techniques that target small screens are usually limited to exploring a few hundred items. In this article we present a scatterplot tool for personal digital assistants that allows the handling of many thousands of items. The application's scalability is achieved by incorporating two alternative interaction techniques: a geometric-semantic zoom that provides smooth transition between overview and detail, and a fisheye distortion that displays the focus and context regions of the scatterplot in a single view. A user study with 24 participants was conducted to compare the usability and efficiency of both techniques when searching a book database containing 7500 items. The study was run on a pen-driven Wacom board simulating a PDA interface. While the results showed no significant difference in task-completion times, a clear majority of 20 users preferred the fisheye view over the zoom interaction. In addition, other dependent variables such as user satisfaction and subjective rating of orientation and navigation support revealed a preference for the fisheye distortion. These findings partly contradict related research and indicate that, when using a small screen, users place higher value on the ability to preserve navigational context than they do on the ease of use of a simplistic, metaphor-based interaction style</docText>

        <docText>Smashing Peacocks Further: Drawing Quasi-Trees from Biconnected Components

We extend the popular force-directed approach to network (or graph) layout to allow separation constraints, which enforce a minimum horizontal or vertical separation between selected pairs of nodes. This simple class of linear constraints is expressive enough to satisfy a wide variety of application-specific layout requirements, including: layout of directed graphs to better show flow; layout with non-overlapping node labels; and layout of graphs with grouped nodes (called clusters). In the stress majorization force-directed layout process, separation constraints can be treated as a quadratic programming problem. We give an incremental algorithm based on gradient projection for efficiently solving this problem. The algorithm is considerably faster than using generic constraint optimization techniques and is comparable in speed to unconstrained stress majorization. We demonstrate the utility of our technique with sample data from a number of practical applications including gene-activation networks, terrorist networks and visualization of high-dimensional data</docText>

        <docText>Visual Exploration of Complex Time-Varying Graphs

Quasi-trees, namely graphs with tree-like structure, appear in many application domains, including bioinformatics and computer networks. Our new SPF approach exploits the structure of these graphs with a two-level approach to drawing, where the graph is decomposed into a tree of biconnected components. The low-level biconnected components are drawn with a force-directed approach that uses a spanning tree skeleton as a starting point for the layout. The higher-level structure of the graph is a true tree with meta-nodes of variable size that contain each biconnected component. That tree is drawn with a new area-aware variant of a tree drawing algorithm that handles high-degree nodes gracefully, at the cost of allowing edge-node overlaps. SPF performs an order of magnitude faster than the best previous approaches, while producing drawings of commensurate or improved quality</docText>

        <docText>FacetMap: A Scalable Search and Browse Visualization

The dominant paradigm for searching and browsing large data stores is text-based: presenting a scrollable list of search results in response to textual search term input. While this works well for the Web, there is opportunity for improvement in the domain of personal information stores, which tend to have more heterogeneous data and richer metadata. In this paper, we introduce FacetMap, an interactive, query-driven visualization, generalizable to a wide range of metadata-rich data stores. FacetMap uses a visual metaphor for both input (selection of metadata facets as filters) and output. Results of a user study provide insight into tradeoffs between FacetMap's graphical approach and the traditional text-oriented approach</docText>

        <docText>Visualizing Business Data with Generalized Treemaps

Business data is often presented using simple business graphics. These familiar visualizations are effective for providing overviews, but fall short for the presentation of large amounts of detailed information. Treemaps can provide such detail, but are often not easy to understand. We present how standard treemap algorithms can be adapted such that the results mimic familiar business graphics. Specifically, we present the use of different layout algorithms per level, a number of variations of the squarified algorithm, the use of variable borders, and the use of non-rectangular shapes. The combined use of these leads to histograms, pie charts and a variety of other styles</docText>

        <docText>Visualization of Barrier Tree Sequences

Dynamical models that explain the formation of spatial structures of RNA molecules have reached a complexity that requires novel visualization methods that help to analyze the validity of these models. We focus on the visualization of so-called folding landscapes of a growing RNA molecule. Folding landscapes describe the energy of a molecule as a function of its spatial configuration; thus they are huge and high dimensional. Their most salient features, however, are encapsulated by their so-called barrier tree that reflects the local minima and their connecting saddle points. For each length of the growing RNA chain there exists a folding landscape. We visualize the sequence of folding landscapes by an animation of the corresponding barrier trees. To generate the animation, we adapt the foresight layout with tolerance algorithm for general dynamic graph layout problems. Since it is very general, we give a detailed description of each phase: constructing a supergraph for the trees, layout of that supergraph using a modified DOT algorithm, and presentation techniques for the final animation</docText>

        <docText>Dynamic Map Labeling

We address the problem of filtering, selecting and placing labels on a dynamic map, which is characterized by continuous zooming and panning capabilities. This consists of two interrelated issues. The first is to avoid label popping and other artifacts that cause confusion and interrupt navigation, and the second is to label at interactive speed. In most formulations the static map labeling problem is NP-hard, and a fast approximation might have O(n log n) complexity. Even this is too slow during interaction, when the number of labels shown can be several orders of magnitude less than the number in the map. In this paper we introduce a set of desiderata for "consistent" dynamic map labeling, which has qualities desirable for navigation. We develop a new framework for dynamic labeling that achieves the desiderata and allows for fast interactive display by moving all of the selection and placement decisions into the preprocessing phase. This framework is general enough to accommodate a variety of selection and placement algorithms. It does not appear possible to achieve our desiderata using previous frameworks. Prior to this paper, there were no formal models of dynamic maps or of dynamic labels; our paper introduces both. We formulate a general optimization problem for dynamic map labeling and give a solution to a simple version of the problem. The simple version is based on label priorities and a versatile and intuitive class of dynamic label placements we call "invariant point placements". Despite these restrictions, our approach gives a useful and practical solution. Our implementation is incorporated into the G-Vis system which is a full-detail dynamic map of the continental USA.

        <docText>Spatial Analysis of News Sources

People in different places talk about different things. This interest distribution is reflected by the newspaper articles circulated in a particular area. We use data from our large-scale newspaper analysis system (Lydia) to make entity datamaps, a spatial visualization of the interest in a given named entity. Our goal is to identify entities which display regional biases. We develop a model of estimating the frequency of reference of an entity in any given city from the reference frequency centered in surrounding cities, and techniques for evaluating the spatial significance of this distribution</docText>

        <docText>Worldmapper: The World as YouAve Never Seen it Before

This paper describes the Worldmapper project, which makes use of novel visualization techniques to represent a broad variety of social and economic data about the countries of the world. The goal of the project is to use the map projections known as cartograms to depict comparisons and relations between different territories, and its execution raises many interesting design challenges that were not all apparent at the outset. We discuss the approaches taken towards these challenges, some of which may have considerably broad application. We conclude by commenting on the positive initial response to the Worldmapper images published on the Web, which we believe is due, at least in part, to the particular effectiveness of the cartogram as a tool for communicating quantitative geographic data</docText>

        <docText>Visualization of Geo-spatial Point Sets via Global Shape Transformation and Local Pixel Placement

In many applications, data is collected and indexed by geo-spatial location. Discovering interesting patterns through visualization is an important way of gaining insight about such data. A previously proposed approach is to apply local placement functions such as PixelMaps that transform the input data set into a solution set that preserves certain constraints while making interesting patterns more obvious and avoid data loss from overplotting. In experience, this family of spatial transformations can reveal fine structures in large point sets, but it is sometimes difficult to relate those structures to basic geographic features such as cities and regional boundaries. Recent information visualization research has addressed other types of transformation functions that make spatially-transformed maps with recognizable shapes. These types of spatial-transformation are called global shape functions. In particular, cartogram-based map distortion has been studied. On the other hand, cartogram-based distortion does not handle point sets readily. In this study, we present a framework that allows the user to specify a global shape function and a local placement function. We combine cartogram-based layout (global shape) with PixelMaps (local placement), obtaining some of the benefits of each toward improved exploration of dense geo-spatial data sets</docText>

        <docText>Hierarchical Edge Bundles: Visualization of Adjacency Relations in Hierarchical Data

A compound graph is a frequently encountered type of data set. Relations are given between items, and a hierarchy is defined on the items as well. We present a new method for visualizing such compound graphs. Our approach is based on visually bundling the adjacency edges, i.e., non-hierarchical edges, together. We realize this as follows. We assume that the hierarchy is shown via a standard tree visualization method. Next, we bend each adjacency edge, modeled as a B-spline curve, toward the polyline defined by the path via the inclusion edges from one node to another. This hierarchical bundling reduces visual clutter and also visualizes implicit adjacency edges between parent nodes that are the result of explicit adjacency edges between their respective child nodes. Furthermore, hierarchical edge bundling is a generic method which can be used in conjunction with existing tree visualization techniques. We illustrate our technique by providing example visualizations and discuss the results based on an informal evaluation provided by potential users of such visualizations</docText>

        <docText>Network Visualization by Semantic Substrates

Networks have remained a challenge for information visualization designers because of the complex issues of node and link layout coupled with the rich set of tasks that users present. This paper offers a strategy based on two principles: (1) layouts are based on user-defined semantic substrates, which are non-overlapping regions in which node placement is based on node attributes, (2) users interactively adjust sliders to control link visibility to limit clutter and thus ensure comprehensibility of source and destination. Scalability is further facilitated by user control of which nodes are visible. We illustrate our semantic substrates approach as implemented in NVSS 1.0 with legal precedent data for up to 1122 court cases in three regions with 7645 legal citations</docText>

We propose a new metaphor for the visualization of prefixes propagation in the Internet.

Based on the new metaphor we propose an algorithm for computing layouts and experiment with such algorithm on a test suite taken from the real Internet. The paper extends the visualization approach of the BGPlay service, which is an Internet routing monitoring tool widely used by ISP operators</docText>

        <docText>Enabling Automatic Clutter Reduction in Parallel Coordinate Plots

We have previously shown that random sampling is an effective clutter reduction technique and that a sampling lens can facilitate focus+context viewing of particular regions. This demands an efficient method of estimating the overlap or occlusion of large numbers of intersecting lines in order to automatically adjust the sampling rate within the lens. This paper proposes several ways for measuring occlusion in parallel coordinate plots. An empirical study into the accuracy and efficiency of the occlusion measures show that a probabilistic approach combined with a 'binning' technique is very fast and yet approaches the accuracy of the more expensive 'true' complete measurement</docText>

        <docText>Measuring Data Abstraction Quality in Multiresolution Visualizations

Data abstraction techniques are widely used in multiresolution visualization systems to reduce visual clutter and facilitate analysis from overview to detail. However, analysts are usually unaware of how well the abstracted data represent the original dataset, which can impact the reliability of results gleaned from the abstractions. In this paper, we define two data abstraction quality measures for computing the degree to which the abstraction conveys the original dataset: the histogram difference measure and the nearest neighbor measure. They have been integrated within XmdvTool, a public-domain multiresolution visualization system for multivariate data analysis that supports sampling as well as clustering to simplify data. Several interactive operations are provided, including adjusting the data abstraction level, changing selected regions, and setting the acceptable data abstraction quality level. Conducting these operations, analysts can select an optimal data abstraction level. Also, analysts can compare different abstraction methods using the measures to see how well relative data density and outliers are maintained, and then select an abstraction method that meets the requirement of their analytic tasks</docText>

        <docText>Multi-Scale Banking to 45 Degrees

In his text Visualizing Data, William Cleveland demonstrates how the aspect ratio of a line chart can affect an analyst's perception of trends in the data. Cleveland proposes an optimization technique for computing the aspect ratio such that the average absolute orientation of line segments in the chart is equal to 45 degrees. This technique, called banking to 45deg, is designed to maximize the discriminability of the orientations of the line segments in the chart. In this paper, we revisit this classic result and describe two new extensions. First, we propose alternate optimization criteria designed to further improve the visual perception of line segment orientations. Second, we develop multi-scale banking, a technique that combines spectral analysis with banking to 45deg. Our technique automatically identifies trends at various frequency scales and then generates a banked chart for each of these scales. We demonstrate the utility of our techniques in a range of visualization tools and analysis examples</docText>

        <docText>Multidimensional visual analysis using cross-filtered views

Analysis of multidimensional data often requires careful examination of relationships across dimensions. Coordinated multiple view approaches have become commonplace in visual analysis tools because they directly support expression of complex multidimensional queries using simple interactions. However, generating such tools remains difficult because of the need to map domain-specific data structures and semantics into the idiosyncratic combinations of interdependent data and visual abstractions needed to reveal particular patterns and distributions in cross-dimensional relationships. This paper describes: (1) a method for interactively expressing sequences of multidimensional set queries by cross-filtering data values across pairs of views, and (2) design strategies for constructing coordinated multiple view interfaces for cross-filtered visual analysis of multidimensional data sets. Using examples of cross-filtered visualizations of data from several different domains, we describe how cross-filtering can be modularized and reused across designs, flexibly customized with respect to data types across multiple dimensions, and incorporated into more wide-ranging multiple view designs. The demonstrated analytic utility of these examples suggest that cross-filtering is a suitable design pattern for instantiation in a wide variety of visual analysis tools.</docText>

        <docText>WEBPATH-a three dimensional Web history

A number of usability studies report that many users of the
WWW cannot find pages already visited, additionally many users cannot
visualise where they are, or where they have been browsing. Currently,
readily available WWW browsers provide history mechanisms that offer
little or no support in the presentation and manipulation of visited
sites. Manipulation and presentation of usage data, such as a browse
history has been used in a number of cases to aid users in searching for
previously attained data, and to teach or assist other users in their
browse or searching techniques. The paper presents a virtual reality
(VR) based application to be used alongside traditional Web browsers,
which provides them with a flexibly tailorable real time visualisation
of their history</docText>

        <docText>Traversal-based visualization of data
        structures

        Algorithm animation systems and graphical debuggers perform
the task of translating program state into visual representations. While
algorithm animations typically rely on user augmented source code to
produce visualizations, debuggers make use of symbolic information in
the target program. As a result, visualizations produced by debuggers
often lack important semantic content, making them inferior to algorithm
animation systems. The paper presents a method to provide higher level,
more informative visualizations in a debugger using a technique called
traversal based visualization. The debugger traverses a data structure
using a set of user supplied patterns to identify parts of the data
structure to be drawn a similar way. A declarative language is used to
specify the patterns and the actions to take when the patterns are
encountered. Alternatively, the user can construct traversal
specifications through a graphical user interface to the declarative
language. Furthermore, the debugger supports modification of data.
Changes made to the on-screen representation are reflected in the
underlying data</docText>

        <docText>Reconfigurable disc trees for visualizing large hierarchical
information space

        We present a new visualization technique, called RDT
(Reconfigurable Disc Tree) which can alleviate the disadvantages of cone
trees significantly for large hierarchies while maintaining its context
of using 3D depth. In RDT, each node is associated with a disc, around
which its children are placed. Using discs instead of cones as the basic
shape in RDT has several advantages: significant reduction of occluded
region, sharp increase in number of displayed nodes, and easy projection
onto plane without visual overlapping. We show that RDT can greatly
enhance user perception by transforming its shapes dynamically in
several ways: (1) disc tree which can significantly reduce the occluded
region by the foreground objects; (2) compact disc tree which can
increase the number of nodes displayed on the screen; and (3) plane disc
tree which can be mapped onto the plane without visual overlapping. We
describe an implementation of our visualization system called VISIT
(Visual Information System for reconfigurable dIsc tree). It provides 2D
and 3D layouts for RDT and various user interface features such as tree
reconfiguration, tree transformation, tree shading, viewing
transformation, animation, selection and browsing which can enhance the
user perception and navigation capabilities. We also evaluate our system
using the following three metrics: percentage of occlusion, density of
displayed nodes on a screen, and number of identifiable nodes</docText>

        <docText>An interactive view for hierarchical
        clustering

        The paper describes a visualization of a general hierarchical
clustering algorithm that allows the user to manipulate the number of
classes produced by the clustering method without requiring a radical
re-drawing of the clustering tree. The visual method used, a space
filling recursive division of a rectangular area, keeps the items under
consideration at the same screen position, even while the number of
classes is under interactive control. As well as presenting a compact
representation of the clustering with different cluster numbers, this
method is particularly useful in a linked views environment where
additional information can be added to a display to encode other
information, without this added level of detail being perturbed when
changes are made to the number of clusters</docText>

        <docText>Dynamic aggregation with circular visual
        designs

        One very effective method for managing large data sets is
aggregation or binning. We consider two aggregation methods that are
tightly coupled with interactive manipulation and the visual
representation of the data. Through this integration we hope to provide
effective support for the aggregation process, specifically by enabling:
1) automatic aggregation, 2) continuous change and control of the
aggregation level, 3) spatially based aggregates, 4) context maintenance
across different aggregate levels, and 5) feedback on the level of
aggregation</docText>

        The paper describes a general formulation of the
?detail-in-context? problem, which is a central issue of fundamental
importance to a wide variety of nonlinear magnification systems. A
number of tools are described for dealing with this problem effectively.
These tools can be applied to any continuous nonlinear magnification
system, and are not tied to specific implementation features of the
system that produced the original transformation. Of particular interest
is the development of ?seamless multi level views?, which allow multiple
global views of an information space (each having different information
content) to be integrated into a single view without discontinuity</docText>

        <docText>Similarity clustering of dimensions for an enhanced visualization
of multidimensional data

        The order and arrangement of dimensions (variates) is crucial
for the effectiveness of a large number of visualization techniques such
as parallel coordinates, scatterplots, recursive pattern, and many
others. We describe a systematic approach to arrange the dimensions
according to their similarity. The basic idea is to rearrange the data
dimensions such that dimensions showing a similar behavior are
positioned next to each other. For the similarity clustering of
dimensions, we need to define similarity measures which determine the
partial or global similarity of dimensions. We then consider the problem
of finding an optimal one- or two-dimensional arrangement of the
dimensions based on their similarity. Theoretical considerations show
that both, the one- and the two-dimensional arrangement problem are
surprisingly hard problems, i.e. they are NP complete. Our solution of
the problem is therefore based on heuristic algorithms. An empirical
evaluation using a number of different visualization techniques shows
the high impact of our similarity clustering of dimensions on the
visualization results </docText>

        <docText>An operator interaction framework for
        visualization systems

        Information visualization encounters a wide variety of
different data domains. The visualization community has developed
representation methods and interactive techniques. As a community, we
have realized that the requirements in each domain are often
dramatically different. In order to easily apply existing methods,
researchers have developed a semiology of graphic representations. We
have extended this research into a framework that includes operators and
interactions in visualization systems, such as a visualization
spreadsheet. We discuss properties of this framework and use it to
characterize operations spanning a variety of different visualization
techniques. The framework developed in the paper enables a new way of
exploring and evaluating the design space of visualization operators,
and helps end users in their analysis tasks</docText>

        <docText>Algorithm visualization for distributed
        environments

        The paper investigates the visualization of distributed
algorithms. We present a conceptual model and a system, VADE, that
realizes this model. Since in asynchronous distributed systems there is
no way of knowing (let alone, visualizing) the ?real? execution, we show
how to generate a visualization which is consistent with the execution
of the distributed algorithm. We also present the design and
implementation of our system. VADE is designed so that the algorithm
runs on the server's machines while the visualization is executed on a
Web page on the client's machine. Programmers can write animations
quickly and easily with the assistance of VADE's libraries </docText>

        <docText>IVORY-an object-oriented framework for physics-based information
visualization in Java

        We present IVORY a newly developed, platform-independent
framework for physics based visualization. IVORY is especially designed
for information visualization applications and multidimensional graph
layout. It is fully implemented in Java 1.1 and its architecture
features client server setup, which allows us to run the visualization
even on thin clients. In addition, VRML 2.0 exports can be viewed by any
VRML plugged-in WWW browser. Individual visual metaphors are invoked
into IVORY via an advanced plug-in mechanism, where plug-ins can be
implemented by any experienced user. The configuration of IVORY is
accomplished using a script language, called IVML. Some interactive
visualization examples, such as the integration of a haptic interface
illustrate the performance and versatility of our system. Our current
implementation supports NT 4.0</docText>

        <docText>Geographic visualization: designing manipulable maps for
exploring temporally varying georeferenced statistics

        Geographic visualization, sometimes called cartographic
visualization, is a form of information visualization in which
principles from cartography, geographic information systems (GIS),
exploratory data analysis (EDA), and information visualization more
generally are integrated in the development and assessment of visual
methods that facilitate the exploration, analysis, synthesis, and
presentation of georeferenced information. The authors report on
development and use of one component of a prototype GVis environment
designed to facilitate exploration, by domain experts, of time series
multivariate georeferenced health statistics. Emphasis is on how
manipulable dynamic GVis tools may facilitate visual thinking, pattern
noticing, and hypothesis generation. The prototype facilitates the
highlighting of data extremes, examination of change in geographic
patterns over time, and exploration of similarity among georeferenced
variables. A qualitative exploratory analysis of verbal protocols and
transaction logs is used to characterize system use. Evidence produced
through the characterization highlights differences among experts in
data analysis strategies (particularly in relation to the use of
attribute ?focusing? combined with time series animation) and
corresponding differences in success at noticing spatiotemporal patterns</docText>

        visualizations

        The authors propose a methodology for automatically realizing
communicative goals in graphics. It features a task model that mediates
the communicative intent and the selection of graphical techniques. The
methodology supports the following functions: isolating assertions
presentable in graphics; mapping such assertions into tasks for the
potential reader, and selecting graphical techniques that support those
tasks. They illustrate the methodology by redesigning a textual argument
into a multimedia one with the same rhetorical and content structures
but employing graphics to achieve some of the intentions</docText>

        <docText>Visualizing decision table classifiers

        Decision tables, like decision trees or neural nets, are
classification models used for prediction. They are induced by machine
learning algorithms. A decision table consists of a hierarchical table
in which each entry in a higher level table gets broken down by the
values of a pair of additional attributes to form another table. The
structure is similar to dimensional stacking. A visualization method is
presented that allows a model based on many attributes to be understood
even by those unfamiliar with machine learning. Various forms of
interaction are used to make this visualization more useful than other
static designs</docText>

        <docText>Comparative visualization of protein structure-sequence
alignments 

        Protein fold recognition (threading) involves the prediction
of a protein's three-dimensional shape based on its similarity to a
protein whose structure is known. Fold predictions are low resolution;
no effort is made to rotate the protein's component amino acid side
chains into their correct spatial orientations. Rather, the goal is to
recognize the protein family member that most closely resembles the
target sequence of unknown structure and to create a sensible alignment
of the target to the structure (i.e., a structure-sequence alignment).
To complement this structure prediction method the authors have
implemented a low resolution molecular graphics tool. Since amino acid
side chain orientation is not relevant in fold recognition, amino acid
residues are represented by abstract shapes or glyphs much like Lego^TM
blocks. They also borrow techniques from comparative streamline
visualization to provide clean depictions of the entire protein
structure model. By creating a low resolution representation of protein
structure, they are able to approximately double the amount of
information on the screen. This implementation also possesses the
advantage of eliminating distracting and possibly misleading visual
clutter resulting from the mapping of protein alignment information onto
a high resolution display of a known structure</docText>

        <docText>The shape of Shakespeare: visualizing text using implicit
surfaces 

        Information visualization focuses on the use of visual means
for exploring non-visual information. While free-form text is a rich,
common source of information, visualization of text is a challenging
problem since text is inherently non-spatial. The paper explores the use
of implicit surface models for visualizing text. The authors describe
several techniques for text visualization that aid in understanding
document content and document relationships. A simple method is defined
for mapping document content to shape. By comparing the shapes of
multiple documents, global content similarities and differences may be
noted. In addition, they describe a visual clustering method in which
documents are arranged in 3D based upon similarity scoring. Documents
deemed closely related blend together as a single connected shape.
Hence, a document corpus becomes a collection of shapes that reflect
inter-document relationships. These techniques provide methods to
visualize individual documents as well as corpus meta-data. They then
combine the two techniques to produce transparent clusters enclosing
individual document shapes. This provides a way to visualize both local
and global contextual information. Finally, they elaborate on several
potential applications of these methods</docText>

        <docText>Multi-faceted insight through interoperable visual information
analysis paradigms

        To gain insight and understanding of complex information
collections, users must be able to visualize and explore many facets of
the information. The paper presents several novel visual methods from an
information analyst's perspective. The authors present a sample
scenario, using the various methods to gain a variety of insights from a
large information collection. They conclude that no single paradigm or
visual method is sufficient for many analytical tasks. Often a suite of
integrated methods offers a better analytic environment in today's
emerging culture of information overload and rapidly changing issues.
They also conclude that the interactions among these visual paradigms
are equally as important as, if not more important than, the paradigms
themselves</docText>

        <docText>H3: laying out large directed graphs in 3D
        hyperbolic space

We present the H3 layout technique for drawing large directed
graphs as node-link diagrams in 3D hyperbolic space. We can lay out much
larger structures than can be handled using traditional techniques for
drawing general graphs because we assume a hierarchical nature of the
data. We impose a hierarchy on the graph by using domain-specific
knowledge to find an appropriate spanning tree. Links which are not part
of the spanning tree do not influence the layout but can be selectively
drawn by user request. The volume of hyperbolic 3-space increases
exponentially, as opposed to the familiar geometric increase of
euclidean 3-space. We exploit this exponential amount of room by
computing the layout according to the hyperbolic metric. We optimize the
cone tree layout algorithm for 3D hyperbolic space by placing children
on a hemisphere around the cone mouth instead of on its perimeter.
Hyperbolic navigation affords a Focus+Context view of the structure with
minimal visual clutter. We have successfully laid out hierarchies of
over 20,000 nodes. Our implementation accommodates navigation through
graphs too large to be rendered interactively by allowing the user to
explicitly prune or expand subtrees.</docText>

        <docText>Visualizing information on a sphere

We describe a method for the visualization of information
units on spherical domains which is employed in the banking industry for
risk analysis, stock prediction and other tasks. The system is based on
a quantification of the similarity of related objects that governs the
parameters of a mass-spring system. Unlike existing approaches we
initialize all information units onto the inner surface of two
concentric spheres and attach them with springs to the outer sphere.
Since the spring stiffnesses correspond to the computed similarity
measures, the system converges into an energy minimum which reveals
multidimensional relations and adjacencies in terms of spatial
neighborhoods. Depending on the application scenario our approach
supports different topological arrangements of related objects. In order
to cope with large data sets we propose a blobby clustering mechanism
that enables encapsulation of similar objects by implicit shapes. In
addition, we implemented various interaction techniques allowing
semantic analysis of the underlying data sets. Our prototype system
IVORY is written in Java, and its versatility is illustrated by an
example from financial service providers.</docText>

        <docText>A spreadsheet approach to information
        visualization

In information visualization, as the volume and complexity of
the data increases, researchers require more powerful visualization
tools that enable them to more effectively explore multidimensional
datasets. We discuss the general utility of a novel visualization
spreadsheet framework. Just as a numerical spreadsheet enables
exploration of numbers, a visualization spreadsheet enables exploration
of visual forms of information. We show that the spreadsheet approach
facilitates certain information visualization tasks that are more
difficult using other approaches. Unlike traditional spreadsheets, which
store only simple data elements and formulas in each cell, a
visualization spreadsheet cell can hold an entire complex data set,
selection criteria, viewing specifications, and other information needed
for a full-fledged information visualization. Similarly, inter-cell
operations are far more complex, stretching beyond simple arithmetic and
string operations to encompass a range of domain-specific operators. We
have built two prototype systems that illustrate some of these research
issues. The underlying approach in our work allows domain experts to
define new data types and data operations, and enables visualization
experts to incorporate new visualizations, viewing parameters, and view
operations.</docText>

        <docText>Adaptive information visualization based on the user's multiple
viewpoints-interactive 3D visualization of the WWW

We introduce the adaptive information visualization method for
hypermedia and the WWW based on the user's multiple viewpoints. We
propose two graphical interfaces, the CVI and the RF-Cone. The CVI is
the interface for interactive viewpoint selection. We can select a
viewpoint reflecting our interests by using the CVI. According to the
given viewpoint, the RF-Cone adaptively organizes the 3D representation
of the hypermedia so that we can understand the semantic and structural
relationship of the hypermedia and easily retrieve the information.
Combining these methods, we have developed the WWW visualization system
which can provide highly efficient navigation.</docText>

        <docText>Managing software with new visual
        representations

Managing large projects is a very challenging task requiring
the tracking and scheduling of many resources. Although new technologies
have made it possible to automatically collect data on project
resources, it is very difficult to access this data because of its size
and lack of structure. We present three novel glyphs for simplifying
this process and apply them to visualizing statistics from a
multi-million line software project. These glyphs address four important
needs in project management: viewing time dependent data; managing large
data volumes; dealing with diverse data types; and correspondence of
data to real-world concepts.</docText>

        <docText>On integrating visualization techniques for effective software
exploration

This paper describes the SHriMP visualization technique for
seamlessly exploring software structure and browsing source code, with a
focus on effectively assisting hybrid program comprehension strategies.
The technique integrates both pan+zoom and fisheye-view visualization
approaches for exploring a nested graph view of software structure. The
fisheye-view approach handles multiple focal points, which are necessary
when examining several subsystems and their mutual interconnections.
Source code is presented by embedding code fragments within the nodes of
the nested graph. Finer connections among these fragments are
represented by a network that is navigated using a hypertext
link-following metaphor. SHriMP combines this hypertext metaphor with
animated panning and zooming motions over the nested graph to provide
continuous orientation and contextual cues for the user. The SHriMP tool
is being evaluated in several user studies. Observations of users
performing program understanding tasks with the tool are discussed.</docText>

        <docText>Cacti: a front end for program
        visualization

We describe a system that allows the user to rapidly construct
program visualizations over a variety of data sources. Such a system is
a necessary foundation for using visualization as an aid to software
understanding. The system supports an arbitrary set of data sources so
that information from both static and dynamic analysis can be combined
to offer meaningful software visualizations. It provides the user with a
visual universal-relation front end that supports the definition of
queries over multiple data sources without knowledge of the structure or
contents of the sources. It uses a flexible back end with a range of
different visualizations, most geared to the efficient display of large
amounts of data. The result is a high-quality, easy-to-define program
visualization that can address specific problems and hence is useful for
software understanding. The overall system is flexible and extensible in
that both the underlying data model and the set of visualizations are
defined in resource files.</docText>

        <docText>Nonlinear magnification fields

We introduce nonlinear magnification fields as an abstract
representation of nonlinear magnification, providing methods for
converting transformation routines to magnification fields and
vice-versa. This new representation provides ease of manipulation and
power of expression. By removing the restrictions of explicit foci and
allowing precise specification of magnification values, we can achieve
magnification effects which were not previously possible. Of particular
interest are techniques we introduce for expressing complex and subtle
magnification effects through magnification brushing, and allowing
intrinsic properties of the data being visualized to create data-driven
magnifications.</docText>

        <docText>Managing multiple focal levels in Table
        Lens

The Table Lens, focus+context visualization for large data
tables, allows users to see 100 times as many data values as a
spreadsheet in the same screen space in a manner that enables an
extremely immediate form of exploratory data analysis. In the original
Table Lens design, data are shown in the context area using graphical
representations in a single pixel row. Scaling up the Table Lens
technique beyond approximately 500 cases (rows) by 40 variables
(columns) requires not showing every value individually and thus raises
challenges for preserving the exploratory and navigational ease and
power of the original design. We describe two design enhancements for
introducing regions of less than a pixel row for each data value and
discuss the issues raised by each.</docText>

        <docText>Coordinating declarative queries with a direct manipulation data
exploration environment

Interactive visualization techniques allow data exploration to
be a continuous process, rather than a discrete sequence of queries and
results as in traditional database systems. However limitations in
expressive power of current visualization systems force users to go
outside the system and form a new dataset in order to perform certain
operations, such as those involving the relationship among multiple
objects. Further, there is no support for integrating data from the new
dataset into previous visualizations, so users must recreate them.
Visage's information centric paradigm provides an architectural hook for
linking data across multiple queries, removing this overhead. This paper
describes the addition to Visage of a visual query language, called VQE,
which allows users to express more complicated queries than in previous
interactive visualization systems. Visualizations can be created from
queries and vice versa. When either is updated, the other changes to
maintain consistency.</docText>

        <docText>Domesticating Bead: adapting an information visualization system
to a financial institution

The Bead visualization system employs a fast algorithm for
laying out high-dimensional data in a low-dimensional space, and a
number of features added to 3D visualizations to improve imageability.
We describe recent work on both aspects of the system, in particular a
generalization of the data types laid out and the implementation of
imageability features in a 2D visualization tool. The variety of data
analyzed in a financial institution such as UBS, and the ubiquity of
spreadsheets as a medium for analysis, led us to extend our layout tools
to handle data in a generic spreadsheet format. We describe the metrics
of similarity used for this data type, and give examples of layouts of
sets of records of financial trades. Conservatism and scepticism with
regard to 3D visualization, along with the lack of functionality of
widely available 3D web browsers, led to the development of a 2D
visualization tool with refinements of a number of our imageability
features.</docText>

        <docText>Design and evaluation of incremental data structures and
algorithms for dynamic query interfaces

A dynamic query interface (DQI) is a database access mechanism
that provides continuous real-time feedback to the user during query
formulation. Previous work shows that DQIs are elegant and powerful
interfaces to small databases. Unfortunately, when applied to large
databases, previous DQI algorithms slow to a crawl. We present a new
incremental approach to DQI algorithms and display updates that work
well with large databases, both in theory and in practice.</docText>

        <docText>Volume rendering for relational data

A method for efficiently volume rendering dense scatterplots
of relational data is described. Plotting difficulties that arise from
large numbers of data points, categorical variables, interaction with
non-axis dimensions, and unknown values, are addressed by this method.
The domain of the plot is voxelized using binning and then volume
rendering. Since a table is used as the underlying data structure, no
storage is wasted on regions with no data. The opacity of each voxel is
a function of the number of data points in a corresponding bin. A
voxel's color is derived by averaging the value of one of the variables
for all the data points that fall in a bin. Other variables in the data
may be mapped to external query sliders. A dragger object permits a user
to select regions inside the volume.</docText>

        <docText>The structure of the information
        visualization design space

Research on information visualization has reached the point
where a number of successful point designs have been proposed and a
variety of techniques have been discovered. It is now appropriate to
describe and analyze portions of the design space so as to understand
the differences among designs and to suggest new possibilities. This
paper proposes an organization of the information visualization
literature and illustrates it with a series of examples. The result is a
framework for designing new visualizations and augmenting existing
designs.</docText>

        <docText>Multidimensional detective

The display of multivariate datasets in parallel coordinates,
transforms the search for relations among the variables into a 2-D
pattern recognition problem. This is the basis for the application to
visual data mining. The knowledge discovery process together with some
general guidelines are illustrated on a dataset from the production of a
VLSI chip. The special strength of parallel coordinates is in modeling
relations. As an example, a simplified economic model is constructed
with data from various economic sectors of a real country. The visual
model shows the interelationship and dependencies between the sectors,
circumstances where there is competition for the same resource, and
feasible economic policies. Interactively, the model can be used to do
trade-off analyses, discover sensitivities, do approximate optimization,
monitor (as in a process) and provide decision support.</docText>

        <docText>Visage: a user interface environment for
        exploring information

Visage is a prototype user interface environment for exploring
and analyzing information. It represents an approach to coordinating
multiple visualizations, analysis and presentation tools in
data-intensive domains. Visage is based on an information-centric
approach to user interface design which strives to eliminate impediments
to direct user access to information objects across applications and
visualizations. Visage consists of a set of data manipulation
operations, an intelligent system for generating a wide variety of data
visualizations (SAGE) and a briefing tool that supports the conversion
of visual displays used during exploration into interactive presentation
slides. This paper presents the user interface components and styles of
interaction that are central to Visage's information-centric approach </docText>

        <docText>Data characterization for automatically visualizing heterogeneous
information

Automated graphical generation systems should be able to
design effective presentations for heterogeneous (quantitative and
qualitative) information in static or interactive environments. When
building such a system, it is important to thoroughly understand the
presentation-related characteristics of domain-specific information. We
define a data-analysis taxonomy that can be used to characterize
heterogeneous information. In addition to capturing the
presentation-related properties of data, our characterization takes into
account the user's information-seeking goals and visual-interpretation
preferences. We use automatically-generated examples from two different
application domains to demonstrate the coverage of the proposed taxonomy
and its utility for selecting effective graphical techniques</docText>

        <docText>Rapid prototyping of information
        visualizations using VANISH

Discusses a software tool called VANISH (Visualizing And
Navigating Information Structured Hierarchically), which supports the
rapid prototyping of interactive 2D and 3D information visualizations.
VANISH supports rapid prototyping through a special-purpose visual
language called VaPL (VANISH Programming Language) tailored for
visualizations, through a software architecture that insulates
visualization-specific code from changes in both the domain being
visualized and the presentation toolkit used, and through the reuse of
visualization techniques between application domains. The generality of
VANISH is established by showing how it is able to re-create a wide
variety of ?standard? visualization techniques. VANISH's support for
prototyping is shown through an extended example, where we build a C++
class browser, exploring many visualization alternatives in the process</docText>

        <docText>On the semantics of interactive
        visualizations

Interactive techniques are powerful tools for manipulating
visualizations to analyze, communicate and acquire information. This is
especially true for large data sets or complex 3D visualizations.
Although many new types of interaction have been introduced recently,
very little work has been done on understanding what their components
are, how they are related and how they can be combined. This paper
begins to address these issues with a framework for classifying
interactive visualizations. Our goal is a framework that will enable us
to develop toolkits for assembling visualization interfaces both
interactively and automatically</docText>

        <docText>Distortion viewing techniques for
        3-dimensional data

As the use of 3D information presentation becomes more
prevalent, the need for effective viewing tools grows accordingly. Much
work has been done in developing tools for 2D spaces which allow for
detail in context views. We examine the extension of such 2D methods to
3D and explore the limitations encountered in accessing internal regions
of the data with these methods. We then describe a novel solution to
this problem of internal access with the introduction of a distortion
function which creates a clear line of sight to the focus revealing
sections previously obscured. The distortion is symmetric about the line
of sight and is smoothly integrated back into the original 3D layout </docText>

        <docText>Selection: 524,288 ways to say ?this is
        interesting? 

Visualization is a critical technology for understanding
complex, data-rich systems. Effective visualizations make important
features of the data immediately recognizable and enable the user to
discover interesting and useful results by highlighting patterns. A key
element of such systems is the ability to interact with displays of data
by selecting a subset for further investigation. This operation is
needed for use in linked-views systems and in drill-down analysis. It is
a common manipulation in many other systems. It is as ubiquitous as
selecting icons in a desktop GUI. It is therefore surprising to note
that little research has been done on how selection can be implemented.
This paper addresses this omission, presenting a taxonomy for selection
mechanisms and discussing the interactions between branches of the
taxonomy. Our suggestion of 524,288 possible systems [2^16 operation
systems2 (memory/memoryless)2 (data-dependent/independent)2
(brush/lasso)] is more in fun than serious, as within the taxonomy there
are many different choices that can be made. This framework is the
result of considering both the current state of the art and historical
antecedents</docText>

        <docText>Towards rich information landscapes for visualising structured
Web spaces

The Harmony browser for the Hyper-G Web server utilises
Hyper-G's rich data model to provide a number of tightly-coupled, two-
and three-dimensional visualisation and navigational facilities. In
particular the Harmony Information Landscape visualises the hierarchical
structure of Hyper-G spaces upon a plane in three-dimensional space. The
Harmony Information Landscape has now been extended to display a
combined structure and link map by selectively superimposing hyperlink
relationships in the vertical dimension above and below the hierarchy
map. In addition, documents returned by search queries may be
selectively ?plotted? in the landscape, indicating their whereabouts in
a broader context, and several sets of 3D icons are available for
representing the various document types</docText>

visualization

This paper describes a minimally immersive volumetric
interactive system for information visualization. The system, SFA, uses
glyph-based volume rendering, enabling more information attributes to be
visualized than traditional 2D and surface-based information
visualization systems. Two-handed interaction and stereoscopic viewing
combine to produce a minimally immersive interactive system that
enhances the user's three-dimensional perception of the information
space, capitalizing on the human visual system's pre-attentive learning
capabilities to quickly analyze the displayed information. The paper
describes the usefulness of this system for the visualization of
document similarity within a corpus of textual documents. SFA allows the
three-dimensional volumetric visualization, manipulation, navigation,
and analysis of multivariate, time-varying information spaces,
increasing the quantity and clarity of information conveyed from the
visualization as compared to traditional 2D information systems</docText>

        <docText>Animating multidimensional scaling to visualize N-dimensional
data sets

Many techniques have been developed for visualizing
multivariate (multidimensional) data. Most, if not all, are limited by
the number of dimensions which can be effectively displayed.
Multidimensional scaling (MDS) is an iterative non-linear technique for
projecting n-D data down to a lower number of dimensions. This work
presents extensions to MDS that enhance visualization of
high-dimensional data sets. These extensions include animation,
stochastic perturbation, and flow visualization techniques</docText>

        <docText>Visualizing the global topology of the
        MBone

We present a case study of visualizing the global topology of
the Internet MBone. The MBone is the Internet's multicast backbone.
Multicast is the most efficient way of distributing data from one sender
to multiple receivers with minimal packet duplication. Developed and
initially deployed by researchers within the Internet community, the
MBone has been extremely popular for efficient transmission across the
Internet of real-time video and audio streams such as conferences,
meetings, congressional sessions, and NASA shuttle launches. The MBone,
like the Internet itself grew exponentially with no central authority.
The resulting suboptimal topology is of growing concern to network
providers and the multicast research community. We create a geographic
representation of the tunnel structure as arcs on a globe by resolving
the latitude and longitude of MBone routers. The interactive 3D maps
permit an immediate understanding of the global structure unavailable
from the data in its original form as lines of text with only hostnames
and IP addresses. Data visualization techniques such as grouping and
thresholding allow further analysis of specific aspects of the MBone
topology. We distribute the interactive 3D maps through the World-Wide
Web using the VRML file format thus allowing network maintainers
throughout the world to analyze the structure move effectively than
would be possible with still pictures or pre-made videos</docText>

        <docText>Visualizing usability log data

Our approach to testing graphical user interfaces involves
logging large amounts of data. These logs capture information at the key
press and mouse click level about how an application is used. Since the
raw data is voluminous and not at a useful level of detail, we use
analysis and visualization to find information that is interesting and
useful to a usability analyst but was previously buried in the data. We
call some of our custom visualizations ?contextual? meaning they use key
elements of the context the data was collected in as an organizing
structure. We expect this type of visualization to be easier and faster
to understand and more helpful than traditional charts. We hope that our
finding a natural geometry for these visualizations will inspire others
whose data apparently has no inherent geometry to find natural ways to
visualize their data</docText>

        <docText>DEPICT: Documents Evaluated as Pictures. Visualizing information
using context vectors and self-organizing maps

HNC Software, Inc. has developed a system called DEPICT for
visualizing the information content of large textual corpora. The system
is built around two separate neural network methodologies: context
vectors and self-organizing maps. Context vectors (CVs) are high
dimensional information representations that encode the semantic content
of the textual entities they represent. Self-organizing maps (SOMs) are
capable of transforming an input, high dimensional signal space into a
much lower (usually two or three) dimensional output space useful for
visualization. Neither process requires human intervention, nor an
external knowledge base. Together, these neural network techniques can
be utilized to automatically identify the relevant information themes
present in a corpus, and present those themes to the user in a intuitive
visual form</docText>

        <docText>Visualizing a tennis match

This paper describes our work on visualizing the information
of a tennis match. We use competition trees to organize the information
of a tennis match and visualize the competition trees by the top-nesting
layered maps with translucent colored layers. We create iconic
representations to describe the detailed information of athletic events
in an intuitive manner. Specialized views of the information are
displayed by applying multiple Magic Lens filters on the top-nesting
layered maps. The dynamic nature of the tennis match is depicted by the
time-varying display. The approach we present in this paper can be used
to visualize other sports information, information with competition
property, or information with hierarchical structure</docText>

        <docText>Visualisation for functional design

We present two novel visualisation tools: the Influence
Explorer and the Prosection Matrix. These were specifically created to
support engineering artifact design and similar tasks in which a set of
parameter values must be chosen to lead to acceptable artifact
performance. These tools combine two concepts. One is the interactive
and virtually immediate responsive display of data in a manner conducive
to the acquisition of insight. The other, involving the precalculation
of samples of artifact performance, facilitates smooth exploration and
optimisation leading to a design decision. The anticipated benefits of
these visualisation tools are illustrated by an example taken from
electronic circuit design, in which full account must be taken of the
uncertainties in parameter values arising from inevitable variations in
the manufacturing process.</docText>

        <docText>Towards a generative theory of diagram
        design

We describe the theoretical background for AVE, an automatic
visualization engine for semantic networks. We have a functional notion
of aesthetics and therefore understand meaningfulness as a central issue
for information visualization. This implies that the diagrams should
communicate the characteristics of the data as effectively as possible.
In this generative theory of diagram design, we include data
characterization, systematic use of graphical means of expression and
the combination of graphical means of expression. After giving a brief
introduction and an application scenario we discuss these aspects in
detail. Finally, a process model of an automatic visualization process
is sketched and directions for further research are outlined.</docText>

        <docText>Research report: information animation applications in the
capital markets

3D computer graphics can be extremely expressive. It is
possible to display an entire securities market, like the S&amp;P 500, on a
single screen. With the correct approach to the visual design of the
layout, these massive amounts of information can be quickly and easily
comprehended by a human observer. By using motion and animated
interaction, it is possible to use 3D as a reliable, accurate and
precise decision-support tool. Information animation applications are
particularly suited to the securities industry because that is where we
find huge amounts of data, the value of which declines rapidly with
time, and where critical decisions are being made on this data in very
short periods of time. Information animation technology is an important
new tool for the securities industry, where people need to be in the
decision-making loop without suffering from information overload.
Several examples are discussed including equity trading analytics, fixed
income trading analytics and fixed-income risk viewing.</docText>

        <docText>Research report: improving browsing in information by the
automatic display layout

It is well known that graphical representations could be very
helpful to browse in graph structured information. But this promising
approach requires the capability of an automatic layout system because
the tedious and time consuming task of a manual layout leads to a
rejection of this approach by the user. In our approach, we split the
task of retrieving information into two phases that are getting the
orientation within the network and reading currently visited
information. We present layout algorithms for both phases which have the
benefit of being flexible and adaptable to individual user requests and
ensure the topological consistency, i.e. the stability of the topology
of the information layout during a sequence of display layouts. The
results show that especially the possibility of an animation of the
layout process can assist the user essentially in maintaining the
orientation in the information network.</docText>

Selective dynamic manipulation (SDM) is a paradigm for
interacting with objects in visualizations. Its methods offer a high
degree of selectivity, in choosing object sets, in the selection of
interactive techniques and the properties they affect, and in the degree
to which a user action affects the visualization. Our goal is to provide
a flexible set of techniques and feedback mechanisms that enable users
to move objects and transform their appearance to perform a variety of
information analysis tasks.</docText>

        <docText>The information mural: a technique for displaying and navigating
large information spaces

Visualizations which depict entire information spaces provide
context for navigation and browsing tasks; however, the limited size of
the display screen makes creating effective global views difficult. We
have developed a technique for displaying and navigating large
information spaces. The key concept is the use of an information mural,
a two-dimensional reduced representation of an entire information space
that fits completely within a display window or screen. Information
murals use grayscale shading and color along with anti-aliasing
techniques to create a miniature version of the entire data set. By
incorporating navigational capabilities, information murals become a
tool that can be used as a global view along with more detailed
informational displays. Information murals are utilized in our software
visualization research to help depict the execution of object-oriented
programs, and can also be used in more general information visualization
applications.</docText>

        <docText>Visualizing the non-visual: spatial analysis and interaction with
information from text documents

The paper describes an approach to IV that involves
spatializing text content for enhanced visual browsing and analysis. The
application arena is large text document corpora such as digital
libraries, regulations and procedures, archived reports, etc. The basic
idea is that text content from these sources may be transformed to a
spatial representation that preserves informational characteristics from
the documents. The spatial representation may then be visually browsed
and analyzed in ways that avoid language processing and that reduce the
analysts mental workload. The result is an interaction with text that
more nearly resembles perception and action with the natural world than
with the abstractions of written language.</docText>

        <docText>VRMosaic: WEB access from within a virtual
        environment

Virtual reality can aid in designing large and complex
structures such as ships, skyscrapers, factories, and aircraft. But
before VR can realize this potential, we need to solve a number of
problems. One of these problems: the user's need to see and interact
with non-geometric information is examined. Our VR environment,
RealEyes, can display large-scale and detailed geometry at reasonable
frame rates (>20 Hz) allowing a user to see and navigate within a design
from a first person perspective. However, much (if not most) of the
information associated with a particular design has no geometric
representation. This includes information such as schematics of
electrical, hydraulic, and plumbing systems; information describing
materials or processes; and descriptive (textual) information of other
types. Many researchers have developed a wealth of techniques for
presenting such data on flat-screen displays, but until recently, we
have not had a means for naturally displaying such information within a
VR environment. To make non-geometric data more available, we have
implemented a version of Mosaic that functions within a fully immersive
VR system. Our system, VRMosaic, allows a user of VR to access and
display most of the data available using flat screen Mosaic. Moreover,
we have made it extensible to allow for the seamless integration of
specialized forms of data and interaction. This paper describes how we
implemented VRMosaic using a VR-capable version of Interviews, It also
describes some Mosaic-like uses of that system and some
"non-Mosaic-like" extensions.</docText>

objects can be attached to database objects in visualizations. Multiple
visualizations may be active simultaneously. Users can interactively lay
out and change between types of query devices. Users may retrieve
details-on-demand by clicking on visualization objects. An HTML file may
be provided along with the database, specifying how details-on-demand
information should be presented, allowing for presentation of multimedia
information in database objects. Finally, multiple IVEE clients running
on separate workstations on a network can communicate by letting one
user's actions affect the visualization in an another IVEE client.</docText>

        <docText>Research report. Interacting with huge hierarchies: beyond cone
trees

The paper describes an implementation of a tool for
visualizing and interacting with huge information hierarchies, and some
preliminary empirical evaluation of the tool's efficacy. Existing
systems for visualizing huge hierarchies using cone trees "break down"
once the hierarchy to be displayed exceeds roughly 1000 nodes, due to
increasing visual clutter. The paper describes a system called fsviz
which visualizes arbitrarily large hierarchies while retaining user
control. This is accomplished by augmenting cone trees with several
graphical and interaction techniques: usage-based filtering, animated
zooming, hand-coupled rotation, fish-eye zooming, coalescing of distant
nodes, texturing, effective use of colour for depth cueing, and the
applications of dynamic queries. The fsviz system also improves upon
earlier cone tree visualization systems through a more elaborate node
layout algorithm. This algorithm enhances the usefulness of cone tree
visualization for large hierarchies by all but eliminating clutter.</docText>

        <docText>Research report. DataSpace: 3-D
        visualizations of large databases

DataSpace is a system for interactive 3-D visualization and
analysis of large databases. DataSpace utilizes the display space by
placing panels of information, possibly generated by different
visualization applications, in a 3-D graph layout, and providing
continuous navigation facilities. Selective rearrangements and
transparency can be used to reduce occlusion or to compare or merge a
set of images (e.g. line graphs or scatter plots) that are aligned and
stacked in depth. A prototype system supporting the basic 3-D graphic
operations (layout, zoom, rotation, translation, transparency) has been
implemented. We provide several illustrative examples of DataSpace
displays taken from the current system. We present the 3-D display
paradigm, describe the query, layout and rendering steps required to
create a display, and discuss some performance issues.</docText>

        information

It is becoming increasingly important that support is provided
for users who are dealing with complex information spaces. The need is
driven by the growing number of domains where there is a requirement for
users to understand, navigate and manipulate large sets of computer
based data; by the increasing size and complexity of this information
and by the pressures to use this information efficiently. The
paradigmatic example is the World Wide Web, but other domains include
software systems, information systems and concurrent engineering. One
approach to providing this support is to provide sophisticated
visualisation tools which lead the users to form an intuitive
understanding of the structure and behaviour of their domain and which
provide mechanisms which allow them to manipulate objects within their
system. The paper describes such a tool and a number of visualisation
techniques that it implements.</docText>

the Harmony Internet browser

The explosive growth of information systems on the Internet
has clearly demonstrated the need to organise, filter, and present
information in ways which allow users to cope with the sheer quantities
of information available. The scope for visualisation of Gopher and WWW
spaces is restricted by the limitations of their respective data models.
The far richer data model supported by the Hyper-G Internet information
system is exploited by its Harmony client to provide a number of
tightly-coupled, two- and three-dimensional visualisation and
navigational facilities, which help provide location feedback and
alleviate user disorientation.</docText>

        <docText>Case study: fishing for information on the
        Internet

As the Internet continues to grow, the amount of accessible
information becomes increasingly vast. Search tools exist that allow
users to find relevant information. However, a search can often produce
such a large amount of data that it becomes hard to ferret out the most
appropriate and highest quality information. In addition, some search
tools lose valuable information when displaying the results to the user.
The paper describes a search visualization tool, called FISH, for
viewing hierarchically structured information and managing information
overload. FISH (Forager for the Information Super Highway) allows users
to visualize the results of search requests across large document spaces
in a way that preserves the structure of the information space. FISH
displays the returned documents as rectangles, using a combination of
order, indentation, size, and color to denote document hierarchy, the
score of the documents with respect to the search, and other data
attributes. In addition, the user can navigate through the document
space for in-depth probing and refinement.</docText>

        <docText>Case study: an empirical investigation of thumbnail image
recognition

The use of thumbnails (i.e., miniatures) in the user-interface
of image databases allows searching and selection of images without the
need for naming policies. Treating parent images prior to reduction with
edge-detecting smoothing, lossy image compression, or static codebook
compression resulted in thumbnails where the distortion caused by
reduction was lessened. An experiment assessing these techniques found
resulting thumbnails could be recognised more quickly and accurately
than thumbnails of the same parent images that had been reduced without
treatment. This pretreatment in thumbnail creation is offered as an
improvement.</docText>

        <docText>Case study: visualizing Internet resources

The goal is to improve the ability of people from all walks of
life and interests to access, search, and use the information
distributed in Internet resources. The process of interacting with
information resources starts with browsing, continues with digesting and
assimilating pieces of information, terminates with generation of new
information, and begins anew with analysis of pre-existing and new
information. Our approach is user-centric-taking users needs into
account by allowing them to interact with the information contained in
large arrays of documents. The visualization process is an integral part
of the overall process. We have covered three related categories in this
methodology. The first one is browsing through the World-Wide Web (WWW)
hyperspace without becoming lost, based on a visual representation of
the hyperspace hierarchical structure (hyperspace view). The second
category is overcoming the rigidity of the WWW by allowing the user to
construct interactively and visually a personal hyperspace of
information, linking the documents according to the application or
problem domain, or to the user's own perception, experience, culture, or
way of thinking. The third category includes discovery and analysis of
new information and relationships in retrieved documents by aggregating
relevant information and representing it visually.</docText>

        <docText>Case study: 3D displays of Internet traffic

The explosive growth in world-wide communications, especially
the Internet, has highlighted the need for techniques to visualize
network traffic. The traditional node and link network displays work
well for small datasets but become visually cluttered and
uninterpretable for large datasets. A natural 3D metaphor for displaying
world-wide network data is to position the nodes on a globe and draw
arcs between them coding the traffic. This technique has several
advantages of over the traditional 2D displays, it naturally reduces
line crossing clutter, provides an intuitive model for navigation and
indication of time, and retains the geographic context. Coupling these
strengths with some novel interaction techniques involving the globe
surface translucency and arc heights illustrates the usefulness for this
class of displays.</docText>
