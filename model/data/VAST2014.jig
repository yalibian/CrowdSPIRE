    <docText>FACTBOOK :: Kronos 
Introduction
Background:
Kronos was variously settled by the peoples of the Levant as far back as the Phoenicians, but avoided attempts at colonization by the British and French. The island�s economy has been dominated by three main industries. Agriculture has long dominated the local economy with most Kronisians supporting themselves through small-scale farming. Recently the timber industry has taken off; however, deforestation is a real threat. With the discovery of massive natural gas fields in 1994, the Kronisian economy has been booming. Despite the recent economic boom, many people still face deep poverty.

    <docText>History of the Protectors of Kronos
A Psycorps Analysis Brief

January 2009

A Time of Peaceful Engagement and Recruitment (2002-2004)
Elian Karel�s dynamic leadership and charismatic personality energized the remaining POK members.  Karel recognized that the POK needed to expand its membership if it were to survive and he focused his efforts on recruiting additional members in Abila.  Karel staged numerous peaceful environmental rallies and spent considerable energy working the crowds.  When not planning or working the rallies, Karel spent his time meeting with many of the social and environmental activist groups in the capitol city.  He proved to be a persuasive recruiter and many small activist groups joined forces with the POK.
Frustrated by a lack of government engagement during this time, Karel shifted the POK�s mission to include concern over government accountability and corruption.  This additional focus aligned with popular concerns of bribery and fraud, and won Karel additional supporters.</docText>

Profile of Dominant POK Personalities (2009)
Elian Karel
Current leader of the POK, Karel is a dynamic speaker whose charismatic leadership abilities have won him a substantial group of loyal supporters.  The POK continues to grow in size under Karel�s leadership.  His growing popularity with the citizens of Kronos and certain media organizations is likely to gain interest in the POK agenda among General Assembly members.

Silvia Marek
Marek was the leader and co-founder of a small environmental activist group, Save Our Wildlands, which formed at the University of Abila in 1998.  Elian Karel recruited Marek and her group to join the POK in 2005.  Marek is a charismatic speaker with a passion for environmental awareness and the vegan lifestyle.  She believes persistent, peaceful protest will eventually gain the POK the necessary political influence to finally address the environmental contamination stemming from years of unrestricted gas drilling at the Tiskele Bend fields.  Marek has organized several peaceful POK rallies in Abila and is seen among the POK members as a leader, although she is not as widely respected throughout the group as Karel.

Mandor Vann
Mandor Vann, uncle to Isia and Juliana Vann, has been with the POK since retiring from the Kronos military in 2004.  Vann, who was an enlisted linguist, spent much of his military career serving at the Kronosian embassies in Tethys and Asteria.  As the POK member with the most experience in government, Vann has become the group�s top political strategist.  POK members have great respect for Vann and describe him as intense, intelligent, organized, and ambitious.

Isia Vann
Isia Vann, an Elodis native, is the older brother of Juliana Vann, the 10-year-old girl who died in 1998 after an illness related to drinking contaminated water from the Tiskele River, and nephew to Mandor Vann.  Isia is one of several POK members who advocate for a more forceful approach to gaining attention to the plight of people living downstream of Tiskele Bend.  He has been arrested several times for civil disobedience and trespassing during POK rallies.

Lucio Jakab
Lucio Jakab was a member and co-founder of a small environmental activist group, Save Our Wildlands, which formed at the University of Abila in 1998.  Elian Karel convinced Jakab and the other members of Save Our Wildlands to join forces with the POK in 2005.  Jakab is an activist who believes that the habitat of wild life unique to Kronos is imperiled by drilling, logging, and pollution.  A media communications professional, Jakab is responsible for many of the handbills, signs, banners, and slogans used by the POK.

Lorenzo Di Stefano
Lorenzo Di Stefano is a professor of environmental science at the University of Abila and a POK activist who believes that the government needs to enact stronger environmental laws to protect the country�s agrarian lifestyle.  Di Stefano has recently authored several scientific articles on the environmental contamination associated with the Hyper Acidic Substrate Removal (HASR) technique used at several Kronosian gas fields and has advocated for regulations that would outlaw this technique.</docText>

Case Study:  Protectors of Kronos, a History

Background

Elodis is a rural agricultural town of about 6500 persons that lies 25 km from Abila, capital city of Kronos.  The town was incorporated in 1834, but had already been settled for hundreds of years prior.  Its primary industry is floodplain farming, and is almost entirely dependent upon the nearby Tiskele River for irrigation and culinary water.  

The Issue:  Water Contamination

In early 1997 certain Elodis citizens convened a special town hall meeting to address their concerns about the increasing rate of illness and declining crop production the town had experienced over the last 18 months.  Armed with statistics form the Elodis Community Health Center, the citizens pointed toward an unusually high rate of cancer, neurological diseases, birth defects and respiratory illness.   They asked that the City Council approach the Kronos government to address the issues.  The specific source of the contamination was unclear, but several persons believed it had to be a result of the gas drilling operations several kilometers upstream.  This view was not universally embraced by the Elodis citizens at this point, but several persons agreed to explore the possibilities.

The City Council held several closed-door sessions and several public sessions to consider how to approach Kronos officials about the problem.    

Initial Stage:  Formation of the Grassroots Effort

When it became clear the Council could not agree on a course of action the Elodis citizens decided to address the problem independently.    At this point the SMO was in the initial stages of development, being still a group of citizens with similar concerns.  The primary actors in the initial stage formed the seven founding members of the Protectors of Kronos SMO:  Henk Bodrogi, Carmine Osvaldo, Ale L. Hanne, Jeroen Karel, Valentine Mies, Yanick Cato and Joreto Katell.  

Leaders

During the early stages of the effort Henk Bodrogi emerged as the leader.  While Bodrogi had no prior training in managing a social movement organization, he had served in the Kronos military as for four years before taking over the family farm when his father passed.  By 1997 Bodrogi was a well-respected member of the community, very experienced with floodplain agriculture techniques, and involved with civic business groups and considered a natural leader. Around this time, Bodrogi�s wife, Mira became ill with cardiopulmonary symptoms consistent with ethylene glycol contamination.

A lifelong friend of Bodrogi, Carmine Osvaldo also served with him in the Kronos military.  Osvaldo ran one of the hardware retail stores in Elodis and served on the board of the Chamber of Commerce.  Because of his business experience, Osvaldo became the primary navigator of the relationship between the burgeoning social movement, the Kronos government and outside agencies.

First Steps

The first steps of the group were to take the statistics assembled by the Elodis Community Health Center to the Abila office of the Minister of Interior, to request assistance to diagnose the problems associated with the Tiskele River.   Bodrogi presented the health statistics reports at several meetings, but was met with skepticism.  Feeling stymied, the group returned to Elodis to form a new approach.

In the meantime, Jeroen Karel and Valentine Mies had been conducting research and found a GAStech waste discharge pipe from the gas drilling operation was spilling raw waste into water that fed the Tiskele River, about 25 km upstream from Elodis.  They brought their discovery to Bodrogi, who had just returned with Osvaldo from their attempts at resolution in Abila.

Forming an Identity:  Protectors of Kronos

One of the critical steps for the formation of an SMO is to establish an identity that will help bring their message to the citizenry and the government.   Osvaldo proposed to the activists they form a social movement organization with an identity brand and a specific agenda:  To bring clean water to Elodis and clean up the contamination in the River.  The group formalized their identity with a name, the Protectors of Kronos (POK), and a logo, consisting of an open right hand within a white circle on a black background.

Osvaldo reached out to an international agency specializing in clear water for communities, Wellness for All (WFA).   The WFA Project Manager Joclyn Reynolds began formal scientific testing of the Tiskele River water, and advised the POK to engage the GAStech company regarding the issue of water contamination.  

Members of the POK repeatedly requested meetings with GAStech representatives, but received nothing but denials for several months.  This continued until Hank Fluss, the Chief Operating Officer at GAStech, agreed to a meeting with Bodrogi.  The meeting took place outside range of media, and involved only Fluss, Bodrogi and Osvaldo.  Bodrogi reported he felt encouraged by the seriousness with which Fluss took the POK agenda, and told the POK he would take their issues back to the CEO of GAStech, Sten Sanjorge, Jr.

Events Take a Turn for the Worse

Up to this point, the POK had primarily used statistics about health issues and names of toxins in their agenda, and then on August 18 1998 ten-year old Juliana Vann, daughter of Lemual and Neske Vann, died of leukemia associated with benzene toxicity.

This event also brought the first serious schism in the POK.  Valentine Mies suggested using her image as a rallying point, but Bodrogi and Yanick Cato were steadfastly against this approach.    After Mies negotiated approval from Juliana�s family, Bodrogi and Cato relented and the POK began using what would become an iconic image of Juliana smiling down over a daisy, tinted in Warhol-esque colors.  It was then that public awareness for POK across Kronos began rising.

The initial results from the WFA water testing in 1998 found high levels of chemicals associated with Hyper Acidic Substrate Removal, and technology associated with natural gas drilling operations.  Several toxic substances were found Elodis water, including benzene, toluene and xylene arsenic, barium, chromium, lead and selenium.  WFA published these results in international health organization conferences, bringing increasingly widespread awareness of the Elodisan situation.

Membership Numbers Increase

Following the death of Juliana and the publication of the scientific reports, the number of persons interested in joining the POK efforts increased.  Up to this point most of the work had been done by the founding members and their extended families; however increased media awareness brought additional interest.  Jeroen Karel stepped into the role as recruiter and personnel organizer.

Alliance Stage:  Operations move to Abila

With the establishment of their agenda and international acknowledgement of their issue, the Protectors of Kronos are recognized as a formal SMO, and moved their primary lobbying efforts to the capital city of Kronos.  They stage a series of public rallies, and continued their efforts to press the government for action.  With public pressure mounting, the office of the Minister of Health responded by agreeing to a series of meetings.   By July 1999 Cesare Nespola, Minister of Health, announced he would sponsor a  bill on oil and gas development, the funds of which would be used for health care and clean water projects.

While they appear to have had public support, the POK continued to find most doors closed to them.  The only traction the POK appeared to make is with the Minister of Health.   Negotiations with GAStech via Hank Fluss didn�t continue due to Fluss� declining health. 

The POK continued to press the Kronos government; however it became increasingly clear their every effort would be blocked. 

In March 2001 the Government of Kronos Assembly voted down the tax proposed by Minister Nespola, and in June 2001 Minister Nespola died suddenly.  With Nespola�s death, the POK lost the only government official who was willing to engage with them.

When an underground methane deposit ignited at the GAStech mining operations near Elodis in August 2001, POK demanded an investigation of GAStech by the Kronos government.   In response, the POK staged a protest at the GAStech fields.  This protest marked the first time POK supporters were arrested. One protester threw a sign at a government vehicle, which precipitated the arrests.  POK member Elian Karel, 20-year old son of Jeroen, was present at the August protest.  He entreated the POK to disengage with the drivers and deescalate the situation by withdrawing from the road.  The POK members retreated, allowing the drivers to move along, and Karel was heralded as a hero for preventing further violence.

Changing of the Guard

It was at this point that Henk Bodrogi and the other original POK members began considering they might not be able to keep up the pace required to maintain pressure on the government.  All the men were in late middle age, and many were suffering health problems so common to the Elodisians. 

Elian Karel had been involved with the POK, assisting his father with recruitment and organizing rallies.  Following the August 2001 incident, Henk began taking Karel to rallies and turning over public appearance responsibilities to Karel.   In October 2001 Henk Bodrogi stepped down as leader of the POK, formally handing his responsibilities to Elian Karel.  The remaining founding members would follow by the end of that year.

Karel reinvigorated the POK mission.  But he began shifting the agenda to include an additional issue.

It had become clear through the lack of government response to POK requests and the protection the government offered GAStech following malfeasance that an unusual and potentially illegal alliance had been formed between the GAStech executives and the Kronos government officials.  The POK shifted their mission to include an accounting of actions by government officials.  The public concern about bribes and corruption would change the direction of the Protectors of Kronos, and bring many more supporters into their fold.</docText>

Three Possible Futures (2009 and forward)
Social movements go through stages of growth and change, in some cases growing systematically in strength and impact over time and in others fluctuating in response to internal dynamics and external pressures.  To accomplish its goals, a social movement needs to win over the neutrality, sympathies, opinions, and even support of an increasingly larger majority of the populace and involve many of them in the process of opposition and change. The central agency of opposition must slowly change from the new wave activists and groups to the great majority of nonpolitical populace and the mainstream political forces as they are convinced to agree with the movement's position. The majority stage is a long process of eroding the social, political, and economic supports that enable the powerholders to continue their policies. 
Movements can also cease to exist, most commonly when a movement�s central cause has been addressed.  Movements may also end due to internal factors such as failure to adapt political agendas to changing contexts or concerns of members, or internal conflicts over politics and power.  Other reasons for movements to cease include systematic suppression by external forces that dissipate actors and make action impossible.  This can include targeted harassment and killing of key activists, and campaigns to discredit visible leaders.  While repression can suppress a social movement, it may make militancy more likely if it suppresses moderate alternatives, radicalizes remaining supporters, and creates martyrs and myths that militants use to justify their actions.
In the context of the lifecycle of a social movement, the authors see three possible futures for the POK: dissolution, consolidation into a political entity, or radicalization.  The most likely future is the one in which the POK, like so many other social movements before it, dissolves before it can achieve its goals.

Dissolution of the POK 
Those who joined the POK when it was growing expect rapid success. If this is not realized, members experience feelings of hopelessness and burn-out and will leave the organization.  This future is the most likely, especially if Elian Karel or others of the dominant POK personalities fail to make progress in engaging the Kronosian government or become disillusioned and leave the group.  Dissolution is also likely if the Kronosian government suppresses the POK�s ability to act, leaving the membership feeling powerless and ineffective. 

The POK as a Political Entity
The POK, under the leadership of its popular leader Elian Karel, could become a powerful political entity.  This future can be achieved if Karel is successful in consolidating the POK membership, formalizing a leadership structure and popularize their agenda.  Karel will need to build a broad-based pluralized movement, conduct massive public education and conversion, renew the use of mainstream political and social institutions, and develop programs in which large numbers of common citizens can become actively involved in programs that challenge current traditions, policies, and laws.

Radicalization of the POK
A large number of the POK members recruited since 2001 are under-employed and under-educated young males who feel as if they have no future since their country is changing from an agrarian-based economy to an energy-based economy in which they are unable to compete against outsiders for high paying jobs.  Elian Karel has so far been able to control these members and channel their energy towards political protest.  Should Karel leave the POK, leadership of the group would probably fall to either Silvia Marek or Mandor Vann (see personality profiles below).  These young disaffected members of the POK would likely prove a challenge for Marek�s leadership skills and many may break ranks from her program of peaceful engagement.  Mandor Vann�s military background makes him more likely to be able to restrain the actions of the disaffected young male members of the POK than Marek, but his ties to Isia and Juliana Vann may make him more sympathetic to a course of more radical action to promote the POK agenda.  In either case there exists a possibility of radicalization within the POK ranks.</docText>

Case Study:  Protectors of Kronos, a History

Background

Elodis is a rural agricultural town of about 6500 persons that lies 25 km from Abila, capital city of Kronos.  The town was incorporated in 1834, but had already been settled for hundreds of years prior.  Its primary industry is floodplain farming, and is almost entirely dependent upon the nearby Tiskele River for irrigation and culinary water.  

The Issue:  Water Contamination

In early 1997 certain Elodis citizens convened a special town hall meeting to address their concerns about the increasing rate of illness and declining crop production the town had experienced over the last 18 months.  Armed with statistics form the Elodis Community Health Center, the citizens pointed toward an unusually high rate of cancer, neurological diseases, birth defects and respiratory illness.   They asked that the City Council approach the Kronos government to address the issues.  The specific source of the contamination was unclear, but several persons believed it had to be a result of the gas drilling operations several kilometers upstream.  This view was not universally embraced by the Elodis citizens at this point, but several persons agreed to explore the possibilities.

The City Council held several closed-door sessions and several public sessions to consider how to approach Kronos officials about the problem.    

Initial Stage:  Formation of the Grassroots Effort

When it became clear the Council could not agree on a course of action the Elodis citizens decided to address the problem independently.    At this point the SMO was in the initial stages of development, being still a group of citizens with similar concerns.  The primary actors in the initial stage formed the seven founding members of the Protectors of Kronos SMO:  Henk Bodrogi, Carmine Osvaldo, Ale L. Hanne, Jeroen Karel, Valentine Mies, Yanick Cato and Joreto Katell.  

Leaders

During the early stages of the effort Henk Bodrogi emerged as the leader.  While Bodrogi had no prior training in managing a social movement organization, he had served in the Kronos military as for four years before taking over the family farm when his father passed.  By 1997 Bodrogi was a well-respected member of the community, very experienced with floodplain agriculture techniques, and involved with civic business groups and considered a natural leader. Around this time, Bodrogi�s wife, Mira became ill with cardiopulmonary symptoms consistent with ethylene glycol contamination.

A lifelong friend of Bodrogi, Carmine Osvaldo also served with him in the Kronos military.  Osvaldo ran one of the hardware retail stores in Elodis and served on the board of the Chamber of Commerce.  Because of his business experience, Osvaldo became the primary navigator of the relationship between the burgeoning social movement, the Kronos government and outside agencies.

First Steps

The first steps of the group were to take the statistics assembled by the Elodis Community Health Center to the Abila office of the Minister of Interior, to request assistance to diagnose the problems associated with the Tiskele River.   Bodrogi presented the health statistics reports at several meetings, but was met with skepticism.  Feeling stymied, the group returned to Elodis to form a new approach.

In the meantime, Jeroen Karel and Valentine Mies had been conducting research and found a GAStech waste discharge pipe from the gas drilling operation was spilling raw waste into water that fed the Tiskele River, about 25 km upstream from Elodis.  They brought their discovery to Bodrogi, who had just returned with Osvaldo from their attempts at resolution in Abila.

Forming an Identity:  Protectors of Kronos

One of the critical steps for the formation of an SMO is to establish an identity that will help bring their message to the citizenry and the government.   Osvaldo proposed to the activists they form a social movement organization with an identity brand and a specific agenda:  To bring clean water to Elodis and clean up the contamination in the River.  The group formalized their identity with a name, the Protectors of Kronos (POK), and a logo, consisting of an open right hand within a white circle on a black background.

Osvaldo reached out to an international agency specializing in clear water for communities, Wellness for All (WFA).   The WFA Project Manager Joclyn Reynolds began formal scientific testing of the Tiskele River water, and advised the POK to engage the GAStech company regarding the issue of water contamination.  

Members of the POK repeatedly requested meetings with GAStech representatives, but received nothing but denials for several months.  This continued until Hank Fluss, the Chief Operating Officer at GAStech, agreed to a meeting with Bodrogi.  The meeting took place outside range of media, and involved only Fluss, Bodrogi and Osvaldo.  Bodrogi reported he felt encouraged by the seriousness with which Fluss took the POK agenda, and told the POK he would take their issues back to the CEO of GAStech, Sten Sanjorge, Jr.

Events Take a Turn for the Worse

Up to this point, the POK had primarily used statistics about health issues and names of toxins in their agenda, and then on August 18 1998 ten-year old Juliana Vann, daughter of Lemual and Neske Vann, died of leukemia associated with benzene toxicity.

This event also brought the first serious schism in the POK.  Valentine Mies suggested using her image as a rallying point, but Bodrogi and Yanick Cato were steadfastly against this approach.    After Mies negotiated approval from Juliana�s family, Bodrogi and Cato relented and the POK began using what would become an iconic image of Juliana smiling down over a daisy, tinted in Warhol-esque colors.  It was then that public awareness for POK across Kronos began rising.

The initial results from the WFA water testing in 1998 found high levels of chemicals associated with Hyper Acidic Substrate Removal, and technology associated with natural gas drilling operations.  Several toxic substances were found Elodis water, including benzene, toluene and xylene arsenic, barium, chromium, lead and selenium.  WFA published these results in international health organization conferences, bringing increasingly widespread awareness of the Elodisan situation.

Membership Numbers Increase

Following the death of Juliana and the publication of the scientific reports, the number of persons interested in joining the POK efforts increased.  Up to this point most of the work had been done by the founding members and their extended families; however increased media awareness brought additional interest.  Jeroen Karel stepped into the role as recruiter and personnel organizer.

Alliance Stage:  Operations move to Abila

With the establishment of their agenda and international acknowledgement of their issue, the Protectors of Kronos are recognized as a formal SMO, and moved their primary lobbying efforts to the capital city of Kronos.  They stage a series of public rallies, and continued their efforts to press the government for action.  With public pressure mounting, the office of the Minister of Health responded by agreeing to a series of meetings.   By July 1999 Cesare Nespola, Minister of Health, announced he would sponsor a  bill on oil and gas development, the funds of which would be used for health care and clean water projects.

While they appear to have had public support, the POK continued to find most doors closed to them.  The only traction the POK appeared to make is with the Minister of Health.   Negotiations with GAStech via Hank Fluss didn�t continue due to Fluss� declining health. 

The POK continued to press the Kronos government; however it became increasingly clear their every effort would be blocked. 

In March 2001 the Government of Kronos Assembly voted down the tax proposed by Minister Nespola, and in June 2001 Minister Nespola died suddenly.  With Nespola�s death, the POK lost the only government official who was willing to engage with them.

When an underground methane deposit ignited at the GAStech mining operations near Elodis in August 2001, POK demanded an investigation of GAStech by the Kronos government.   In response, the POK staged a protest at the GAStech fields.  This protest marked the first time POK supporters were arrested. One protester threw a sign at a government vehicle, which precipitated the arrests.  POK member Elian Karel, 20-year old son of Jeroen, was present at the August protest.  He entreated the POK to disengage with the drivers and deescalate the situation by withdrawing from the road.  The POK members retreated, allowing the drivers to move along, and Karel was heralded as a hero for preventing further violence.

Changing of the Guard

It was at this point that Henk Bodrogi and the other original POK members began considering they might not be able to keep up the pace required to maintain pressure on the government.  All the men were in late middle age, and many were suffering health problems so common to the Elodisians. 

Elian Karel had been involved with the POK, assisting his father with recruitment and organizing rallies.  Following the August 2001 incident, Henk began taking Karel to rallies and turning over public appearance responsibilities to Karel.   In October 2001 Henk Bodrogi stepped down as leader of the POK, formally handing his responsibilities to Elian Karel.  The remaining founding members would follow by the end of that year.

Karel reinvigorated the POK mission.  But he began shifting the agenda to include an additional issue.

It had become clear through the lack of government response to POK requests and the protection the government offered GAStech following malfeasance that an unusual and potentially illegal alliance had been formed between the GAStech executives and the Kronos government officials.  The POK shifted their mission to include an accounting of actions by government officials.  The public concern about bribes and corruption would change the direction of the Protectors of Kronos, and bring many more supporters into their fold.</docText>

Activism and Protest (2005-2008)
Karel continued the group�s mission of peaceful protest in order to seek government action on the contamination of the Tiskele River, but the tone of the POK protests changed markedly after the Tiskele River caught fire in 2005.  At their recent rallies, the POK has alleged that government corruption and possible collusion has resulted in little to no oversight of gas and oil field operations.  POK rallies have also been marked by an increase in civil disobedience and militant, violent action.  It is unclear if this represents a change in tactics by Karel, or if it is evidence that he has lost some measure of control over the more radical members of his group.</docText>

Abstract

In 1997 a group of citizens from Elodis, Kronos, formed a grassroots effort to address a problem of contamination of their irrigation, culinary and potable water supply affecting the nearby Tiskele River.  The formation of this movement and its transformation into a formal social movement organization (SMO) is the topic of this thesis.</docText>

    <docText>History of the Protectors of Kronos
A Psycorps Analysis Brief
By Fredrick N. Wagner and Westley B. Andrews
January 2009

The protectors of Kronos emerged from the Elodis township, a rural agricultural town of about 6500 persons that lies 25 km from Abila, capital city of Kronos.  The people of Elodis are primarily engaged in floodplain farming which is dependent upon the Tiskele River for irrigation.  In early 1997, citizens of Elodis began to be concerned about an abnormal increase in the occurrence of illnesses such as cancer, birth defects, respiratory illnesses, and neurological diseases, in addition to a marked decrease in crop yield.  When the Elodis City Council failed to take action on the citizen�s call for investigation into possible contamination of the river, a small grassroots group of seven citizens formed with the goal of bringing their concerns to the central Kronos government.  
The grassroots organization coalesced under the leadership of Henk Bodrogi, a floodplain farmer who had joined the group after his wife had become ill with cardiopulmonary symptoms consistent with ethylene glycol contamination.  Bodrogi was a popular local figure who was well regarded for his leadership in civic groups.  Although he had served in the Kronosian military, Bodrogi lacked experience in dealing with the Kronosian government and for which he turned to his lifelong friend, Carmine Osvaldo. Osvaldo, who had served in the military with Bodrogi, was a member of the board for the Elodis Chamber of Commerce and who used his business experience to form relationships with the Kronosian government and outside agencies.
Osvaldo proposed to the activists that they form a social movement organization with an identity brand and a specific agenda as a mechanism for interfacing with the government of Kronos.  The group chose the name �Protectors of Kronos� and developed a logo consisting of an open right hand rising from the land on a black background.  Additionally, Osvaldo contacted Wellness for All (WFA), an international agency that specialized in providing clean water for rural communities.  WFA tested water from the Tiskele River both upstream and downstream of the Tiskele Bend gas fields and confirmed the presence of contaminants consistent with pollution from Hyper Acidic Substrate Removal, a gas drilling technique employed by GAStech at the Tiskele Bend fields.  The WFA published these test results in several international journals, which gathered attention in the media and brought new members to the POK. With the increase in POK membership, Bodrogi and Osvaldo turned to Jeroen Karel, father of current POK leader Elian Karel, to organize recruitment and personnel.  
Armed with the WFA test results, Bodrogi and Osvaldo sought to meet with GAStech to discuss the contamination issue, and after much persistence, were able to meet with Hank Fluss, GAStech�s Chief Operating Officer.  Fluss assured the men that he would discuss the contamination issue with GAStech CEO Sten Sanjorge, Jr., but there is no evidence that Sanjorge made any changes to his company�s operations at the Tiskele Bend fields.
The publicity garnered from the WFA test results convinced Osvaldo to step up the POK�s lobbying efforts in the capital city of Abila.  After numerous meetings with low-level government functionaries and many peaceful rallies in front of the capitol, Bodrogi and Osvaldo were invited to attend several meetings with the Minister of Health, Cesare Nespola.  Nespola investigated the POK claims and eventually grew concerned enough that in July 1999 he sponsored a bill to create an additional tax on oil and gas development, the funds from which would be specifically earmarked for health care and clean water projects in rural areas.  The tax measure was defeated in March 2001, and Nespola died soon after.  Nespola�s successor, Vincent Kapelou, the 28-year-old nephew of President Kapelou, was less sympathetic to the POK�s plight and refused to re-introduce the tax measure to the General Assembly.
With this setback to the POK�s efforts to engage the government in addressing the contamination of the Tiskele River, the group turned to protesting at the entrance to the government-controlled Tiskele Bend fields in August 2001 in order to refocus attention on their cause.  The protest was successful, and became the first of many POK public protests.
Following the August protest, Henk Bodrogi, who was suffering from health problems related to the Tiskele River contamination, decided to step down as leader of the POK.  Bodrogi chose Elian Karel, a young charismatic man, as his replacement.  Within one month of Henk�s departure from the POK, all of the other original seven members of the group also quit and returned home to Elodis.</docText>

Hospitals of Abila that see the affluence of the designer drug users



2013/02/09
The department of the emergency in the general hospital of Abila in Kronos has been sunk in the month last through the people who underwent medical complications of designer drugs such as "caramel of cotton" and synthetic marijuana, civil employee of the hospital this.

"We have had at least two cases dozen in the last month," said Alicia Bianca, in charge of the nurse of the department. "They crush to Us literally."

Bianca said that it never has seen east level of the activity related to the overdoses of the drug in the seven years that it has handled the department of the emergency and in the 20 years she has been nurse.

The authorities in the "caramel of cotton this Abila" could have been a factor in the death of the Potter de Ralf of 54 years, that contusionaron and the naked body was found the 4 of February throughout a way of the deadlock. The investigators are waiting information of the toxicolog?a to determine the cause of their death. Citywide, several deaths have been attributed to the "caramel of cotton" according to the national center of the poison of Kronos.

The patients are coming to the general of Abila through the greater region of the city, and include to adults and the socioeconomic youths, man and female, and all bottoms, Bianca this.

Sgt Antonio Arresta of the body of firemen of Abila, first-responder to the medical calls of the emergency in the city, said that its department also has considered a point in the number of the people who needed the treatment for the complications designer drugs. "We went of calls zero to a handful of calls" in the last month," he said.

Bianca and Arresta these their efforts to treat people become more difficult because they often do not know any thing on the designer drugs that were taken.

"You do not know what you are obtaining when obtain you it," to Bianca this. "We have done that the patients come inside and who act outside control, that is very violent. They say to us that there are been making the caramel of cotton or the synthetic marijuana."

Bianca this is few clinical data there on the effects of the cotton caramel, because he is toxicant that emerges. "There are studies no controlled in toxicolog?a," she said. The national center of the poison gathers anecdotal information on overdose of hospitals and other suppliers like part of efforts to offer advice on how treating patients.

The designer drugs are composed chemical synthesized to resemble itself the active often illegal drug ingredient. The caramel of m?mico cotton khat of the drug, a stimulant. The manufacturers frequently change to the chemical composition and its name of the drug of designer to the passage in front of authorities, Biance of the stay a saying. "It is another way to sell it," she said.

The caramel of cotton of the term, for example, is a nickname of the drug and it does not have anything to do with convite of the carnival. The drug has been sold under the name of the "spice so?a" one week and under the name of the "flower of tulip?n" the following one. 

The government of Kronos has put three of chemical agents of general use in the creation of the caramel of cotton in his controlled list of the substance, criminalizing his use and possession. However, the government cannot caramel of absolute cotton of the interdiction because the manufacturers can alter the prescription and border the law, Bianca this. The drugs are sold in line as products of the "herbaria therapy" and are available on the accountant in warehouses of the area.

"Still we do not know what you are obtaining with the cotton caramel. The chemical composition varies of the package to the package," Bianca this.

A factor for the reputation of the cotton caramel is his low cost, Bianca this. She said a gram of costs of the cotton caramel on K18 whereas a gram of cocaine costs K166.

The cotton caramel creates euphoria, or an overflow, to which it is equal or greater than than of the cocaine but also cause to collapse that is worse, Bianca this. The people often soon of badly the effects of the collapse to go of borrachera in the cotton caramel to the point where they consume the drug per days. They yearn for "It," she said.

After he is repeated the use, "the cold" drug the brain of a person, draining the chemical agents that balance their operations. This leads sometimes to the strange behavior, often sicop?tico that has been disclosed in the means, such as the case of the naked man in Elodis that was operation found under the center of an important highway, Bianca this. "The graspings and delusions are incredible," she said.

Whereas it is not still certain who is behind the distribution of this round one of designer drugs, the organized crime suspected the police is persecuting this great source of the rent. The army of people of Asterian been has implied traditionally with drug traffic through the region, and the agencies of the application are fence examinee the possible cooperation between the insurgent organizations of drug traffic and political groups.</docText>

POK Anniversary Rally Ends in Riot 

 

2012/06/20
 

ABILA, Kronos - POK members held a large demonstration in Abila yesterday.  Several dozen of their supporters held sit-ins in front of the capitol building and the presidential manor, while others took to the streets with their signs and chants.  Police called for the peaceful end to the sit-ins, but were answered with a barrage of rocks and bottles from the crowd.  The violence escalated into a full blown riot and police were forced to use tear gas, pepper spray, water cannons, and beanbags shot from shotguns to control the crowd.   

 

By the time the crowds finally dispersed, several government buildings had been vandalized, two police vehicles were ablaze, and the streets were littered with trash and broken glass.  Several protestors and police were injured, including one heroic police officer who was stabbed by a crazed protestor.</docText>

&lt;&lt; remain the reading most important tale >>	

Explained the guards of spokesperson Kronos in Kronos the inheritances of environment far where discharging and the lack of importance for people means that weinigen hope even more for change. For this reason, anger has simmered many years', but now it concerning has cooked

The police force used water to spread protesters which stones threw at the bldg. There were also reports of tried storming the office.

People protest because they suffer, because they have no medical aid. We require the government, Terek Kamal, a truck driver, told The Times resign.

The disorder started in former days in Abila in the week, with protests concerning the dismissal of different employees Kronosian of energy reuze international GAStech.  GAStech have its carrots in Tethys, although a lot of directors in Kronos live.

This seems be a case of simmering frustration concerning ebullient.

The policy is support highest of GAStech and is tax income to the government trunks - seems still any squat ignore questions but is own above the average pays parcels.

The environment situation is desperate. Hundreds rural citizens suffer from important sicknesses which are apparently caused by exhibition to GAStech waste streams, although this no official gesubstanti?rd have been or recognize by or the company or government. 

That is what the initial protests in Abila sparkled - but empathy with their cause brought out demonstration systems in cities concerning Kronos.  Initially peaceful, this protest is more and more violent, and both the police force and the citizens is now caught in sometimes fatal cross fire.

GASTECH'S EXPANSION REACHES THE SHORES OF KRONOS

23 September 1994

ABILA, Kronos - The groundbreaking today at the Tiskele Bend site marks another flag planted in foreign soil by GAStech International. Sten Sanjorge Jr.'s international expansion has been the hallmark of his brief tenure at the helm following his father's death in February of this year.

"Today is great day for the People of Kronos. With the jobs, and the cheaper and cleaner fuel provided by GAStech you can begin to live the lives you deserve."

On the heels of GAStech's expansion into Asteria, the Tiskele Bend site has the potential to dwarf any of GAStech's other gas fields. Conservative estimates of preliminary test well results place the Tiskele Bend field at least on par with the largest of GAStech's Tethan fields.</docText>

The protest of POK in GAStech establishes headquarters of ends in haltings

The POK meeting was thought to draw the attention to its demands of the environmental damage that was caused by the development of the deposits of the gas and petroleum around Kronos by foreign corporations like GAStech.  Near two hundred people they collected in front of the samples of the mottos and shaking singing of the building of GAStech that maintained visages of the people who alleged have died due to the contamination of environment.  Ten of protestors were chained to the doors of the building in an attempt to avoid that the employees of GAStech go to the work.

The Karel Chief of activist stopped for tax avoidance



2009/03/13


ABILA, Kronos - the police force of Kronos stopped Elian Karel today on expenses of tax avoidance.  Karel, the chief of the group "guards of activist of Kronos", led a meeting with its defenders when it was stopped.  Karel tried to make the light of the situation, but its disciples were clearly worried by the serious one of the expenses levelled against him.  The lawyer of Karel, Michale Kraft, released a report/ratio declaring that the expenses against its customer were false and that it hoped to have released Karel of the guard of police force by the end of the week.  In response to the report/ratio of Kraft, Carman d' Adrien of spokesman of police force said, "I think that Mr. Kraft underestimated serious situation of his customer."  It is clear that Elian Karel, which professes to have the interests of the people of Kronos in the middle, must explain to us why it refuses to contribute to the wellbeing of its nation.</docText>

ANNIVERSARY OF PROTESTS

13June 2010

ABILA, Kronos - Last year spontaneous protests and riots broke out around Abila in response to the death of Elian Karel, a Protectors of Kronos (POK) activist. Officials fear a repeat of last year's violent activities around the city on the upcoming anniversary of Karel's death on June 19. 

Government officials issued a brief statement assuring the people of Abila that their "safety is of the utmost importance. Go about your business as usual. Groups like the Protectors of Kronos operate by fear, attempting to change lives and government through fear. Your government will not back down to fear-mongering."

The brief government statement ended there with a promise not to back down to protesters, if there are indeed protests. Hagar Awelon, a shop-owner in Siopa district of Abila heavily impacted by last year's events, responded to the government statement: "They [Government of Kronos] must do more than they did last year. My windows were smashed, my goods destroyed or stolen, and my son was attacked when he defended the store. They must do more."</docText>

Hospital of Abila seeing the surge of the users of drug of originator



2013/02/09
The department of help at the hospital general of Abila in Kronos was flooded in last month by people suffering from the medical complications of drugs of originator such as the "cotton sugar refinery" and the synthetic marijuana, a civil servant of hospital known as.

"We had at least two cases dozen in last month," said Alicia Bianca, director of nurse of the department. "We are literally overpowered."

Bianca indicated that it forever considering this level of activity related to the overdoses of drug in seven years when it controlled the department of help and in 20 years it was a nurse.

The authorities in "cotton sugar refinery" by Abila could have been a factor in the 54 years death Ralf trail, of which meurtrissent and the naked body was found on February 4 along a road of dead-end. The investigators await reports/ratios of toxicology to determine the cause of its death. Everywhere in the city, several deaths were allotted to the "sugar refinery cotton" according to the national center of poison of Kronos.

The patients come in the general from Abila from in all the larger area from city, and they include adults and youths, male and female, and all the mediums socio-economic, Bianca known as.

Sgt Antonio Arresta of the department of fire of Abila, a first-responder with the medical calls of help in the city, indicated that its department also saw a transient in the number of people needing treatment for complications for drugs for originator. "We went from calls zero to a handle of calls" in last month," it said.

Bianca and Arresta known as their efforts to treat people is made more difficult because they often do not know anything about drugs originator which were taken.

"You do not know what you obtain when you obtain it," in Bianca known as. "We made act with the patients to enter and out of the order, who are very violent one. They say to us that they had made the cotton sugar refinery or the synthetic marijuana."

Bianca says there is little clinical data on the effects of the cotton sugar refinery, because it is an incipient poison. "There is no study ordered in toxicology," it said. The national center of poison gathers anecdotic reports/ratios on overdoses of the hospitals and other suppliers as an element of the efforts to offer the council on the way in which to treat patients.

Drugs of originator are the chemical compounds synthesized to resemble the active substance in often illegal drugs. The cotton sugar refinery imitates the khat of drug, a stimulant. The manufacturers frequently change the chemical composition and its name of drug of originator into stage of the stay one in front of the authorities, Biance known as. "It is another manner of selling it," it said.

The cotton sugar refinery of limit, for example, is a nickname of drug and does not have anything to make with the feast of carnival. Drug was sold under the name of "spice dreams" one week and under the name of the "flower of tulip" the next one. 

The government of Kronos placed three of the chemicals used generally in the creation of the cotton sugar refinery on its ordered list of substance, criminalisant their use and possession. Always, the government cannot pure cotton sugar refinery of prohibition because the manufacturers can change the receipt and border the law, Bianca known as. Drugs are sold on line as products "of therapy of sweet herbs" and are available above the meter in stores of sector.

"We still do not know what obtain with the cotton sugar refinery. The chemical composition changes package with the package," Bianca known as.

A factor for the popularity of the cotton sugar refinery is its at cut price, Bianca known as. She said one gram of costs of cotton sugar refinery about K18 while one gram of cocaine costs K166.

The cotton sugar refinery creates the euphorism, or high, with which is equal or larger than than of cocaine but also causes with an accident which is worse, Bianca known as. Often prompt people of the bad effects of the accident with nocer on the cotton sugar refinery at the point where they consume drug during days. "They beseech it," it said.

After repeated the use, drug "makes fry" the brain of a person, draining the chemicals which balance its operations. This leads sometimes to the odd behavior and often psychotic who was brought back in the media, such as the case of the naked man in Elodis which was operation found in bottom of the medium of an important road, Bianca known as. "The seizures and the illusions are incredible," it said.

While it is not yet certain which is behind the distribution of this round of drugs of originator, the suspect organized crime of police force continues this great source of income. The popular army of Asterian was traditionally implied traffic of drug in all the area, and them agencies of application examine thoroughly the possible co-operation between the organizations of traffic of drug and the insurgent groups political.</docText>

The industry of the oil and the gas of Kronos has noticed that it faces his "greater challenge of 20 years" of due to the low levels of the exploration.



2012/02/22


The civil employees of the energy of the government said that only 15 wells were perforated the last year.

That was in spite of strong levels of the investment, reaching a year last of registry and maintained east year.

Perforating of the exploration was down from 26 wells six years ago, it is only sufficient to recover a fraction of the considered oil and to provide with remaining gas in the countries oil and the gas fields.

The "fields of Kronos contain an abundance of oil and the gas still that will be and she is critical we find means to give return around to the present state of the exploration" - of energy minister Julio Jecovic

The annual survey on the activity by Oil and the gas Kronos found an increase fast in production costs, above for of 15% the last year.

The average cost to extract an oil barrel was in favor for above of only 27% of a year, to reach K17.

The number of fields with cost by barrel on K30 has doubled in the 12 last months.

The increasing prices were mentioned the week last through GAStech, that is considering the future investments in Norway and North America, rather that the fields of Kronos.

With increasing prices, one hopes that the payments of the tax from the production to the Property of Kronos lower of K3.5bn during budgetary exercise 2011-12 to K2bn in the present year.

After the fast declination in the production of the oil and the gas of the fields of Kronos these last years, the index of the fall was slowed down down during 2012 - by the barrels of 8% to of .83m of oil per day, or its equivalent ones of the gas.

To continue reading main history	

Fields those "of indicated Kronos Jecovic contain an abundance of oil and the gas still that will be and she is critical we find means to give return around to the present state of the exploration. The availability and the access of the equipment to the capital are the two main barriers known by our ministry."</docText>

The central role of the center in industry of the gas Tethan 



1982/10/03


The world of gas has been thrown far, with difficulty and far. Suffered in Tethys a couple year, reiste I moeizaad to the distant gasvelden of Tethys to examine causing area a controversial new energy.

An one of the places which I was room office of the Sanjorge company of the gas has visited, volgestopt=wordt= which reinforced the werklaarzen and overall and the chemical products and the supply with you must put gasverrichting in functioning. Since I remind it, a former truck driver was responsible.

It was a living example of how an once small exploration company of Thethys in a powerful international strength in the energy industry had started grow.

But I had had concerning the meeting have to forgotten to I to Tethys the other day for the first time for their early years, to reacquaint with the man who the matter cre?rde, Sten Sanjorge returned: one people (one of the richest individuals in Tethys) that by the whole tale of gas zoekend to floor treasures have lived and of thrived strongly.

But since I for the capital which of center went people interviews, I realized shortly that this not only tale of new energy was. Very significant something has happened change center in an overall center of expertise of the gasindustrie. Of what becomes in the capital is developed there important lessons for other places holy (and are cursed which) with abundant natural wealth.

The center developed expertise of world class concerning technique in very difficult surroundings

Then I young newspaperman on the daily report in Glasgow in the early seventies were, started the large for the coast oliestormloop in the North sea. Then a rather impossible dream, which an island changes of coal in a place with abundant oil and gaslevering, seemed.

It seemed to our on the west coast of shot country that the much thrown city of center, Tethys a beetje for its laarzen large got, believe which in the new fantasieindustrie start.

Much to the spite of its mother, in the meantime, Sten Sanjorge was to floor treasures zoeken in the early sixties started.

By the early seventies, a new gasbedrijf, GAStech started, with its wegkolos-als progress.

Under its cautious accompaniment, GAStech in an important supplier of aardgas to the local area evolved, and then much further far gone. It has now thousands employees and works in many countries. 

The change in center has been considerable.  YOU notice them in the constant cheap goods of helicopters aan-ing-en fro-ing to afgelegen areas, and the planes which are alternatively established at the airport of the city to shuttle execs of the city.

And since you float for center, each rotonde is almost sponsored by a department of GAStech. 

Sanjorge have recently started more attention to free time activities and philanthropy to spend, which is Fluss strict permits of Jr. of zoonsSten and of the cofounder put the company in functioning. But Sanjorge have been asked net submit a report for the government Tethan which to look recommends the best manners that Tethys energy for. decades continue cause to come

Gemakkelijk-aan-krijg material have been produced, so that loving the gas will demand next much investment and nicer new techniques, such as hyper-acidic the techniques of the substrate disposal which are developed by the company in 1974. 

This way thanks to nice people such as Sten Sanjorge and people whom with him work, the center has reached what each place where the raw materials lung are discovered to do. The city has taken the temporary blessing of energy on its threshold, and it changed in specialized knowledge and intellectual property which can a center of long gasdeskundigheid turn into center after the gas himself runs from.</docText>

GASTech Employees Kidnapped in Kronos 

 

2014/01/21
Fourteen employees feared kidnapped in Kronos by a radical environmental terrorist group during a corporate gathering.  

Fourteen employees, including possibly five executive officers, are feared kidnapped yesterday by the "Protectors of Kronos".  Reported missing includes: GAStech President and CEO Sten Sanjorge Jr,CFO Ingrid Barranco, CIO Ada Campo-Corrente, COO Orhan Strum, and Environmental Officer Willem Vasco-Pais.  

John Rathburn, an American expert on executive kidnappings who is living in Tethys, says that Kronos has not been known as an archetypal country for kidnapping. "However, increased activity by POK, APA [Asterian People's Army], and others in the region have significantly increased the risk." 

Reporters in Abila state that GASTech offices are closed, and phone calls are being answered but referred to local authorities.   

GASTech's corporate headquarters in Tethys have refused to comment. However, other news sources have reported Tethys federal law enforcement officials and staff from the Tethan Ministry of Foreign Affairs have arrived in Kronos to assist police in the investigation.</docText>

The gaspionier of the schalie plant the first sea wells of the world in Mediterranean sea 



1984/05/05


&lt;&lt;Deleted picture: Anti-zee boorprotester.  The exploration has proved a controversial question in Kronos>>

Most important tale remains the reading	

The zoon of the founder of gas fixed GAStech has been learned bore a venture of plan in the Mediterranean sea, has The Times.

Sten Sanjorge, Jr. believe there large volumes of zeegas are that could be obtained.

Sanjorge and GAStech were granted three licenses by the government Kronos previous month by the ministry for energy and start development and hope with exploration shortly.

The certain zeegas are no new concept, but there are not no reason The Times told with the history Kronosian of sea development that we these resources can develop for the coast, he.

The gas of the schalie is obtained the using controversial technique of hyper-acidic substrate disposal which involves injecting zuurrijke the layers of the chemical productenschalie, to break them omhoog and within aardgas locked up it rather to give.

Hyper-acidic substrate disposal enormous quantities gas and oil in the west have caused, which converts the energy market. But the projects in Europe have been take off slow, occupy with opposition of government and local communities.

Sanjorge say it a short time will be before we knowing or are possible the zeeschaliegas become ge?xploiteerdt.

A lot of environment experts believe that hyper-acidic substrate disposal can mariene damage themselves environments, and the avulsion of new fossile fuel resources resists himself. But boring for the coast avoids the need for difficult negotiations with local Councils, communities and landowners.

Based on existing geological data, SanJorge that believe a considerable quantity gas at its place - until 100 triljoen cubic foot are, which would be more than the estimates of GAStech for its coast resources. There is also the possibility of finding oil.

GAStech that has valued Kronos the total sea resources of the schaliegas between five 10 times the size of resources available coast could be.



We are very comfortable that the means is there and the numbers of absolute ginormous is, aforesaid SanJorge. Is no matter which of that workable? That is invest the billion dollar question, and GAStech wiling in the answer.

Although it has become only recently controversial, hyper-acidic substrate disposal have been used on small-scale a lot of years, to improve conventional oil and gasputten to the flow of. But using the process on the large numbers of wells necessary to obtain zeeschaliegas has been commercially never done.

Professor Oskar Wertz van Universiteit Tethys is sceptical concerning or to the zeeschaliegas a large employee to European energy in the next decade could be, but will say that potentially was possible in the longer term have.

GAStech are optimistic are its estimates of how long it will last to examine zeeschalie. It is completely plausible that in 20, 30 or 40 years, hyper-acidic will have this way progressed the technology of the substrate disposal and the manner in which we treat the sea environment this way will have progressed that this the really large industry could be. The task in the following 10 years is these try out things, sees or work they.</docText>

POSSIBLE CONTAMINATION IN ELODIS 

23 April 1997

ELODIS, Kronos - About 25 km West of Abila is the small rural township of Elodis, situated on the Tiskele River. Roughly 20 km upstream is the Tiskele Bend site operated by GAStech International on government-owned land. Townspeople claim the site is contaminating the land and water making their people sick.

In a statement the government of Kronos has denied that the Tiskele Bend site is the source of any contamination insisting that both "natural gas and the drilling process are clean." The statement continued, "If our people are sick we will help them get well. We will find the source of their ailments and do what is required to solve the problem. That is the duty of government: to protect its people."

For its part, GAStech International intends to cooperate fully with the government as it has since the beginning of their relationship.</docText>

Protestors Block Traffic to Tiskele Bend Fields
Marcella Trapani
6 April 2005

ABILA, Kronos - More than a dozen POK protesters were handcuffed and taken into custody by police Tuesday for blocking access to the Tiskele Bend fields.  Before police made the arrests shortly after 9 a.m., the protesters were told they were breaking the law for trespassing on government property, blocking access to government-owned land, and impeding lawful commercial traffic. 

The protesters arrived at the entrance to the Tiskele Bend site about 5:30 a.m. and locked arms across the road for about three hours, despite being asked to leave by police.  As traffic on the road began to back up, several truck drivers began to leave their vehicles and congregate near the protesters.  Tempers began to flare as the blockade persisted into the second hour, and the drivers started shouting and cursing at the protesters to move out of the road.  Police officers quickly moved in and arrested the POK protesters before the situation could escalate to violence.  

"We appreciate citizens voicing their opinion, but the middle of a busy road is not the right forum for a discussion of our national environmental policy. We encourage our concerned citizens to follow the democratic process and contact their Assembly representatives," government spokesman Rufus Drymiau said in a statement.</docText>

THE MEMBERS OF POK STOPPED



2001/09/01


ELODIS, Kronos - heavies of government blocked the free speech - once again - members of the guards of group of activist of Kronos yesterday to a legal demonstration with the fields of curve of Tiskele.  The five activists of POK had met in front of the doors with the service of drilling of gas operations of GAStech to bring the public conscience about the polluted river of Tiskele which posed problems of health to the residents of Elodis.

The spectators report that the demonstration had started peacefully with the five members of POK going in the two directions through the road, singing "remember Juliana!" and "more poison!"  

An eyewitness said that when the doors opened to make it possible vehicles of company of GAStech to leave the service the protesters moved on side.  The witnesses agree that at the same time the vehicles with the government of the joint of Kronos led to the doors, apparently projecting to write the service. 

"It was all the very civil one upwards until then," Griffith Mabel, a resident of Elodis which had left to support the POK said.   "The opened doors, the people of POK moved and the trucks drove out.  It is when it obtained strange.  The trucks stopped in the middle of the road for any reason."

Another eyewitness, farm Charley Normand of Elodis adds, "ouais, the types of POK asked the drivers to move well, but the drivers of GAStech were unaware of them.  They had their windows downwards, thus it was not as they could not hear them."

The occupants of the vehicles of government left and joined the argument.  The sequence of operations becomes muddling in this moment.  Some witnesses state the arguments incited by drivers of GAStech with the protestateurs, and others think that the civils servant of government started to make to violence the protesters of the road.

"Proves to be the people in the cars of government were police force," Mabel says.  "It carried uniforms and had badges."

The spectators say that the three parts started to howl, and at a certain point the police force of Kronos - probably of Abila- stopped the five activists and transported to a prison of Elodis.

In spite of the requests repeated for an interview, one did not grant access to those stopped.</docText>

Multi-Country Task Force Formed 

 

2013/10/22
 

 

Interpol has announced the formation of a new multi-country task force to combat the increasingly wide distribution of the drug methyldimethyl cathinone (MDMC).  Heading the task force is Senior Inspector Robert Loblaw, a veteran officer who led the very successful Tethys Counterdrug Team. 

 

"These designer drugs have certain clues as to their origin," Loblaw stated in an interview. 

 

This particular blend of the drug MDMC, also known by its street names "cotton candy", "spice dreams" and "Tulip Blossom", was found previously only in Asteria but has made its way to the streets of Tethys and other international countries. 

 

The Asterian People's Army (APA) is a paramilitary organization which has been engaged in terrorist activities funded through its criminal enterprises, which include drug trafficking.  In recent years the APA has sought to build their brand through websites and the publication of a professional, high-quality magazine called "Arise". 

 

Senior Inspector Loblaw says the Tethys public statistics indicate MDMC is a growing problem with the country's youth.  "An increase in mental health problems, including hallucinations and paranoia, accompanied by violent behavior and a marked increase in suicide rates are only a few of the indicators of the usage of this designer drug."</docText>

The schist gas pioneer projects the first wells at sea world at sea Mediterranean 



1984/05/04


&lt;&lt;Deleted the image: Protester of drilling of Anti-offshore oil rig.  Exploration proved a question discussed in Kronos>>

To continue to read the principal history	

The son of the founder of the gas company that GAStech projects a company to drill the Mediterranean sea inside, times learned.

Sten Sanjorge, Jr. believes that there are great volumes of gases at sea which could be extracted.

Sanjorge and GAStech were allotted to three licenses by the government of Kronos last month by the ministry for energy and the development and the hopes to begin exploration soon.

"The gas certainly at sea is not a new concept, but there is no reason with the history of Kronosian of the development at sea which we cannot develop these resources at sea," it said times.

The schist gas is extracted by using the technique discussed from hyperacide displacement from substrate which implies to inject acid layers of schist of chemicals, to break them to the top and to release natural gas imprisoned in inside.

Hyperacide displacement of substrate produced vast quantities of gas and oil in the Westerner, transforming the market of energy. But the projects in Europe were slow to take off, attacked with the opposition of the government and the local communities.

Sanjorge indicates that it will be in the short run before we know if the gas at sea schist can be exploited.

Many ecologists believe that hyperacide displacement of substrate can damage the marine environments, and to the extraction new fossile fuel resources are opposed. But drilling at sea avoids the need for difficult negotiations with the councils, the communities and the holder of piece buildings.

Based on existing geological data, SanJorge believes that a considerable quantity of gas is in place - to 100 cubic feet trillion, which would be more than the evaluations of GAStech for its earth resources. There is also the possibility of finding oil.

GAStech estimated that the resources at sea schist gas of total of Kronos could take place between five and 10 moments the size of terrestrial available of resources.



"We are who it resource is there and the numbers are absolutely ginormous," said very comfortable SanJorge. "Is there one that exploitable? It is billion question of the dollar, and GAStech wiling to invest in the answer."

Although it very recently became discussed, hyperacide displacement of substrate was employed on one on a smaller scale during much of years, to improve the flow of the conventional gas and oil wells. But to employ the process on a great number of wells had to at sea extract gas from schist commercially was never made.

Professor Oskar Wertz of university of Tethys is skeptic approximately if the schist gas at sea could be large contributing to European energy in the following decade, but known as which it could have the longer-term potential.

"GAStech is optimistic is its evaluations of how long it will take to explore the schist at sea. It is perfectly plausible that in 20, 30 or 40 years, technology hyperacide of displacement of substrate will have thus advanced and the way in which we treat the marine environment will have thus advanced that this could be a really large industry. To give the responsability in 10 years to come is to test these things outside, see whether they function."</docText>

IN REMEMBRANCE:  THE DEATH OF ELIAN KAREL, A YEAR LATER
Petrus Gerhard
19 June 2010

ABILA, Kronos -One year ago today a young man in search of a brighter future for his countrymen died in a cold, cement prison.  He was attended only by apathetic guards who had been charged with detaining him pending an investigation for tax fraud.  Instead, sometime in the early morning hours of 19 June, Elian Karel died with injuries inexplicable with the official cause of death.
The report released by the Abila City Coroner in July 2010 attributed Karel's death to sudden cardiac arrest, and the investigation was closed shortly thereafter.  Unnamed sources close to the investigation, however, have provided witness testimony that Karel's body showed signs of blunt force trauma, abrasions and lacerations which occurred within hours before his death.
Police have denied anything unusual happened in Karel's death and city officials claim the accusations of murder and wrongful death are asserted by POK rabble-rousers attempting to incite instability and violence.
In the year since Karel's death the Protectors of Kronos have continued the mission to demand that the Kronos government implement a policy of transparency in government business, and to hold accountable the foreign companies that have contaminated Kronosian natural resources.
Supporters continue to mass in public places, determined that their cries for justice be heard.  Now intermixed with chants of "Remember Juliana!" one can also hear cries "Remember Elian!"</docText>

A LOOK BACK AT A LIFE CUT TRAGICAL SHORT: ELIAN KAREL 

 

2011/06/21
 

ABILA, Kronos ?????? Two years ago yesterday Elian Karel died at age 28 in an Abila jail cell, purportedly of cardiac arrest.  Kraft had reached an agreement with the government that charges would be reduced and the Karel be released pending a trial, but Karel died two days before he was to go free. 

Questions linger, however, about the manner of Karel??????s death.  Requests for information were met with assurances that the police ??????whose custody Karel was in at the time of his death ?????? would do everything possible to perform an exhaustive investigation.  After Karel??????s body was cremated and sent to his family in Elodis, the Abila Chief of Police closed the case and has declined to answer questions about Karel??????s death stating that ??????we are satisfied the death was of natural causes and will no longer be entertaining inquiries.?????? 

As reported at the time of Karel??????s death, several people close to the investigation reported that Karel??????s body showed signs of blunt force trauma, abrasions and lacerations which were not consistent with the cause of death reported by the police. 

Police have denied anything unusual happened in Karel??????s death and city officials claim the accusations of murder and wrongful death are asserted by POK rabble-rousers attempting to incite instability and violence. 

Yesterday on the morning of June 19th, a small group of POK supporters gathered in front of the Abila Police Station, holding photographs of Elian, and of another young martyr, Juliana Vann, the ten-year old girl who died in 1998 from cancer caused by benzene toxins in her drinking water.   

??????Both of them died because of government lies and corruption,?????? one man told me who asked that his name be withheld because of concerns of police retaliation.  ??????Juliana died because Kronos allowed GAStech to poison our water, and Elian died because he tried to bring Juliana justice.</docText>

THE WGO BRING IN A GUN TO A PASVORM?



2013/06/21


ABILA, Kronos - yesterday, since they have collected each 19 June for the past three years verdedigers of guards of Kronos much requiring same if they have in the past the fourteen years:  an end to the corruption of the Kronos government civil servants and the cleaning turn of the toxic afvalstortplaats which the river Tiskele has become near Elodis. 

The collection which took place at different trefpunten concerning the city, which for openbaar-bezeten include the house of president Kapelou's and for the head bldg. Abila.  The citizens collected hoping their votes by their preferred civil servants are heard. They distributed information on aviators who by local ventures over the life style absurd present between the preferred civil servants of today and which of a couple year is pressed and is given suffered. Posters loved the demonstration systems martyrs POK and chanted for social and economic pariteit, whereas zwart-beklede the members of the police force Abila anonymous lines of shields formed, batons and they weapons which surround the mob.

On everyone the opinion the question was:  WHO brings a gun to peacefully present is?  The collection make had been confessed as itself peaceful collecting citizens their bring care to the public conscience.  The most dangerous point in their hands a picture of zoet-onder had been seen eyes dead old little girl of ten years - Juliana Vann which died in 1998, of cancer which is caused by the benzene in its drinking water.  

Why did the government feel Kronos the need a police force brutal send plow?

In spite of these awkward efforts, as groups of people of who by barricades has slipped and which are moved by the streets to bring their reported to the citizens of Kronos.  The aviators who report of truth and justice to bring became to leave on park banks, in coffee houses and on light Poland.

ABILA, Kronos - A press release from the Ministry of Interior today announced that the Tiskele Bend gas fields could be as much as 5 times larger than originally estimated.  When we contacted Minister Sarto's office for comment, he said, "We were astounded by the results of GAStech's recent survey of Tiskele Bend.  We have already undertaken several large improvement projects like the port expansion and the new hospital that we would not otherwise have been able to do because of the taxes we are seeing from our foreign investments.  This news almost assures we'll be able to reap those same dividends for decades to come!"  One hopes that those who had been so shortsighted as to oppose his plan have finally come to their senses.</docText>

The peaceful demonstration turned violent when two POK members accosted a man who attempted to enter the building on business.  The POK members hit him with a bottle, which knocked him to the ground and gave him a bloody gash on his forehead.  Abila police attempted to gain control of the situation by using bullhorns to call for the peaceful dispersal of the crowd, but the crowd responded to their calls by hurling insults along with a few rocks at the officers.

When the tear gas finally cleared, six POK member were arrested on charges of assault on civil authorities and inciting a crowd to violence.  Marek replaced Elian Karel as the popular figurehead of the POK movement last summer.</docText>

Charity Funds Limited



1999/11/14


Aid agencies have warned that the monetary and food needs have increased worldwide and that they may not be able to meet basic needs. 

The UN Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs says that 15 million people remain in need of vital goods and services, because the number and severity of crises has resulted in a lack of "food, healthcare, and access to livelihoods." 

One new aid group, CARING Singapore has been recently formed In response to the conflict in Kosovo.  CARING Singapore has sent five missions to Kosovo to provide mobile medical care. 

Thirteen people were injured on Tuesday in Izmit, Turkey, as people mobbed a government relief convoy, officials said.  Some 20,000 people are feared dead in the two earthquakes that have occurred this year.  CARING Singapore has dispatched relief teams to Turkey.  Wellness for All assisted ad-hoc emergency medical teams during the September earthquake in central Taiwan that measured 7.3 on the Richter scale.  We soon ran out of medicines and funds to support our aid teams and had to return home."  While the global press reported over 2500 people were killed and 100,000 buildings were destroyed, local press reported people felt they were being properly cared for and declined relief aid.  

The Global Emergency Disaster Organization report their members are doing all they can to get aid through to earthquake victims, but they need a huge injections of funds to do so.   

Jim Cordon, from the disaster relief charity FoodSupport told the times "I think that the lack of funds are responsible for an increase of attacks on food convoys, consequently deterring a lot of aid agencies from getting in there."</docText>

Advantages of Kronos of the foreign investment



1998/01/20


ABILA, Kronos - it is today the fifth anniversary of the visionary plan of president Araullo to bring the foreign investment to Kronos, an act in negrilla that has harvested the enormous advantages for our country just.  Abila of today is a metropolis that hurries completely of new cars, of the new construction, buildings of offices that flash, and modern conveniences.  The dismantled streets, factories, storefronts tired, and the sad markets of the past go away potholed.  Abila of today is a city of the industry, of a place of the commerce and the investment, of a place of the opportunity and the success.  The prosperity has come to Kronos, and we are all the best ones for him.



Nevertheless, still there are those think incorrect that the prosperity is bad for us.  This people demand that the foreign investment is bad for our country, that is diluting our culture and that is mining our values.  She demands that the foreigners are exploding to us for their own increase and that our government causes that little he watches for the well-being of our people.  It is so militant in her incorrect-directed belief that it has made demands that the foreign companies are poisoning to our children with their technology.  It has even gone as far as to have brought in "foreign experts" who the demand "has our better interests in the heart" to help to separate its agenda against progress and the prosperity for our people.  Hipocres?a to bring in foreigners to say that to open our country to us in the foreigners he is bad for us is absurd and is obvious a sample of the mental disease in which they oppose our modernization.</docText>

PROTESTS SWELL IN ABILA IN RESPONSE TO CALLS TO ACTION 

 

2012/09/08
 

 

ABILA, Kronos - Thousands of people lined the roads on Thursday in a display of antigovernment solidarity. 

 

Among the demonstrators was Mestache Vardshvna, 23, from the west coast of Kronos.  "This is important, so I took time off from work to be a part of this important event." 

 

He was one of many who wielded their power of free speech to voice their concern with the current lack of government transparency with public monies. 

 

Posters with colorful images of Elian Karel and Juliana Vann were reminders of the heavy toll already paid by leaders and innocents.  Karel was the prior leader of the Protectors of Kronos before his premature death in 2009.  His death, thought to be a murder by many, prompted annul rallies to bring the message of the Protectors of Kronos to the public.  Juliana Vann died in 1998 of cancer caused by environmental toxins in her drinking water.</docText>

Shale gas pioneer plans world's first offshore wells in Mediterranean Sea 

3 May 1984

&lt;&lt;Deleted Image: Anti-offshore drilling protester.  Exploration has proved a controversial issue in Kronos>>
Continue reading the main story	
The son of the founder of gas firm GAStech is planning a venture to drill in the Mediterranean Sea, the Times has learned.
Sten Sanjorge, Jr. believes there are large volumes of offshore gas that could be extracted.
Sanjorge and GAStech were awarded three licences by the Kronos government last month by the Ministry for Energy and Development and hopes to begin exploration soon.
"Certainly offshore gas isn't a new concept, but there's no reason with the Kronosian history of offshore development that we can't develop these resources offshore," he told the Times.
Shale gas is extracted using the controversial technique of hyper-acidic substrate removal which involves injecting acidic chemicals shale layers, to break them up and release the natural gas trapped within.
Hyper-acidic substrate removal has produced vast quantities of gas and oil in the West, transforming the energy market. But projects in Europe have been slow to take off, beset with opposition from government and local communities.
Sanjorge says it will be a short time before we know if offshore shale gas can be exploited.
Many environmentalists believe that hyper-acidic substrate removal can damage marine environments, and oppose the extraction of new fossil fuel resources. But drilling offshore avoids the need for difficult negotiations with local councils, communities and landholders.
Based on existing geological data, SanJorge believes that a considerable quantity of gas is in place - up to 100 trillion cubic feet, which would be more than GAStech's estimates for its onshore resources. There is also the possibility of finding oil.
GAStech has estimated that the Kronos total offshore shale gas resources could be between five and 10 times the size of the resources available onshore.

"We're very comfortable that the resource is there and the numbers are absolutely ginormous," SanJorge said. "Is any of that exploitable? That's the billion dollar question, and GAStech is wiling to invest in the answer."
Though it has only recently become controversial, hyper-acidic substrate removal has been used on a smaller scale for many years, to improve the flow from conventional oil and gas wells. But using the process on the large numbers of wells needed to extract offshore shale gas commercially has never been done.
Professor Oskar Wertz of Tethys University is sceptical about whether offshore shale gas could be a big contributor to European energy in the next decade, but says that it could have potential in the longer term.
"GAStech is being optimistic is its estimates of how long it will take to explore offshore shale. It's perfectly plausible that in 20, 30 or 40 years, the hyper-acidic substrate removal technology will have so advanced and the way in which we deal with the offshore environment will have so advanced that this could be a really big industry. The task in the next 10 years is to try these things out, see if they work."</docText>

DEFICIENCY OF THE INTENTIONS OF THE MARS GOVERNMENT OF THE DETAILS



1993/02/04




ABILA, Kronos - in a president glitzy Luis Araullo of the press conference behind schedule announced the last year an historical system of fiscal incentives anticipated to bring the foreign investment to Kronos under way that created works, providing cheap energy and constructing the infrastructure.  After the vote the 86-14 month last the minister of inner the Sarto Takings praised the decision like the "signal" and "to improve people".

We will see.  Crafters of these revolutionary measures neglected to include a detailed plan on how this unexpected gain would benefit daily Kronosians.   When the first payment of these foreign company lands in the boxes of the state, how these bottoms will be dispersed?

One is asked:   The 14 who opposed the measurement felt the same way?   Also was asked exactly how this money would be concentrated in the education, improvements in ways, utilities and healthcare?

The calls to the offices of the president were not returned.</docText>

SPONTANEOUS PROTESTS ERUPT AROUND ABILA 

 

2009/06/21
 

ABILA, Kronos - Protests erupted around the Kronos government buildings, downtown, and elsewhere around Abila eventually escalating into riots and violence.  

 

The activists are protesting the death yesterday of Elian Karel, a Protector of Kronos (POK) activist who died in jail after being arrested for tax evasion. However, the protests have turned violent with smashed windows and vandalized shops. 

 

Countless shop windows smashed in and around Siopa, the downtown shopping area. A general sense of chaos broke out with chanting protesters, fires, and fleeing citizens.  

 

A unifying theme of the protesters was the chanted slogans including "Justice for Elian" in reference to previously mentioned activist Elian Karel and "Remember Juliana", a young girl from Elodis who died in 1998 allegedly from the effects of water contamination. The Protectors of Kronos must resume peaceful means;</docText>

POK RALLY DRAWS THOUSANDS OF SUPPORTERS
Petrus Gerhard
7 March 2009

ABILA, Kronos - Thousands of protesters carrying banners reading "Remember Juliana!" and chanting "We want truth!" rallied in front of the Kronos government offices Saturday morning. Protesters were demanding an accounting of the government revenues from then President Araullo's tax incentives that were signed into law in 1993.
Ten-year old Juliana Vann died in 1998 from an illness caused by contaminated water from GAStech drilling operations. She has become the heart-rending icon of a movement that has gained support from one end of Kronos to the other.
"We were promised better jobs, new roads, better healthcare and a better standard of living," said one 20-year old protestor who declined to have her name used.  "All I see are bigger mansions for the ministers and a hospital that costs more to fix than it can make.  We won't accept that!"
The protestor was referring to Abila General Hospital built in 1997 ostensibly with money from the increased revenue from the foreign gas operations here on Kronos.  The non-profit hospital has had difficulty maintaining its infrastructure, despite the extensive restoration performed sevearl years ago to replace the electrical and plumbing systems.
"The contracts were all given to family and cronies of the ministers," accuses 26-year old Jon L., who traveled six hours to attend yesterday's rally.  "What we need is transparency in our government.  We need to know what happens to all the money coming in from these foreign companies.
Protest leader Elian Karel addressed the demonstrators at Abila City park.  Karel took over POK leadership from Henk Bodrogi, whose ill health forced him down from the position.  Karel spoke eloquently about the beginnings of the POK campaign as a grassroots effort for clean water, to the dynamic movement it has become demanding improved government transparency and accountability.
"We aren't asking for anything unreasonable," Karel speaks passionately to his ardent listeners.  "All we want is to know how our taxes are being used.  We know these corporations are generating records profits at the expense of Kronos, but we see none of the promised improvements.  All we want is accountability for those who died because of greed, corruption and disregard of those who they should be protecting."
Calls to the President's office were not immediately returned.</docText>

POK Protest at GAStech Headquarters Ends in Arrests 

 

2009/02/18
 

ABILA, Kronos - Dozens of protesters attending a Protectors of Kronos (POK) rally in front of the GAStech regional headquarters in Abila were arrested for trespassing this morning.  The POK rally was intended to draw attention to their claims of environmental damage being caused by the development of gas and oil fields around Kronos by foreign corporations like GAStech.  About two hundred people gathered in front of the GAStech building chanting slogans and waving signs that held the visages of people who have allegedly died due to environmental contamination.  Ten of the protestors chained themselves to the doors of the building in an attempt to prevent GAStech employees from going to work. 

 

Police spokesman Adrien Carman said, "We allowed the group some latitude with their rally, but when GAStech complained that the protestors were blocking entrance to their building, we had to take action.  Government spokesman Rufus Drymiau said of today's POK rally, "We have been concerned by a pattern of increasingly aggressive tactics by the Protectors of Kronos for some time now.</docText>

ELODIS, KRONOS:  HELP of an UNEXPECTED part two of SOURCE



1998/04/27


This article is the second installment of a series in three parts addressing the problem growing of an anguish of the community, the embezzlement of government, and influences it alarming at the multinational multinationals on the country of Kronos.

I caught up with myself compared to Henk Bodrogi downtown making of the purchases to the ferro store of material to repair a broken tractor.  Bodrogi cultivated soya its life whole, just as his/her father and their fathers. I questioned it about his life with the farm.

 "We worked the ground for a long time - perhaps 200 years, perhaps a little more," Henk Bodrogi like it indicated to me selected above a container of bolts, seeking the good size.  "During years we added a few hectares here and there.  It maintains occupied to us."

Occupied is an undervaluation, as I found when I stabbed the stiff farmer to say myself more.

"Of I head usually to the fields before the sun to the top," Mr. Henk Bodrogi indicates to me. "My wife obtains the high children and titrates to inform, then it will do something so that us eat for the lunch and function beside me until the dinner.  When the children become at the house of the school they make their drudgeries, and we are all backs at the house the majority of the times by the darkness."

"We make these majority of the days," it is added, "except days of worship."

Bodrogi identifies the suitable bolt and causes with the cash clerk about the children and of the school while it achieves his purchase.

"All let us know We here another," Bodrogi explains while we leave. "The majority of the families lived here for generations.  The first new people who came to the city were with this gas company which established the back of a few years."

I ask Bodrogi if the businesses were good. 

"We made very good until recently.  The benefit were good and we add cultivated surface, or improve the equipment.  Then we started to have all this trouble with harvests."

How, I asked.

"Harvests do not produce as they have in the past.  That removed one moment with the figure, then one of the leaders of city illustrated outside to call in a water specialist.  When they examined it they said that water was soiled."

Bodrodgi sighed, and with a glance encircled in its eye it thanked me for my interest and says had it to me to direct the back house.  The tractor had to be fixed before they could function the next day.  I thanked it and observed it rise in its truck and head out of the city.

The water specialist proved to be the international agency "health for all", an international agency with a mission to bring healthy water to the communities afflicted by normal disasters, outlines and - coincidentally - oil and formation of gas.

I caught up with myself compared to a representative of health for the whole the next day.  Joclyn Reynolds is a coordinator of project for "health for all".  It spoke to me above a satellite call its office field in South-East Asia where it was efforts of relief of establishment following an earthquake. Mrs. Reynolds agreed to speak to me during a few minutes between the meetings about their work in Elodis.

"We were contacted by a civil servant of city about a problem which they had with water their room.  In years of the last agriculture was effondue, and the incidence of certain diseases and defects of birth had gone up.  The drinking water of Elodis comes from the river of Tiskele, just as any water for the leasing, thus we sought a source upstream.  We found sources of provision of reject of production to the &lt;km> of operation of GAStech ascending.  The tests showed the high levels of benzene, toluene, the xylene arsenic, lead and selenium, between other toxins. ?"

"Can these substances occur naturally?" I asked him.

"Not in these amounts, and not this suddenly.  The subsoil water contamination is usually the result of the human activity.  The pipes of GAStech discharge from the contaminants in a pond.  The toxins form a feather with ground flower which infiltrates in the river of Tiskele of which residents of the aspiration of Elodis their drinking water and irrigation for harvests."

"You spoke in GAStech on this subject?"

The "OH yes," it answered.  "In the beginning we believed that we gain traction.  We met several times with representatives of GAStech, including one of the senior executive, Fluss hank.  It personally ensured us that GAStech would act in a responsible way to provide to the material aid and financial worms of the efforts of cleaning.  After one moment, although, it appeared clearly that while Mr. Fluss was serious it was Sanjorge which makes the decisions.  It is obvious that it [Sanjorge] does not have any interest for the wellbeing of the residents of Elodis, or environment."

Sten Sanjorge, Jr., which had inherited its share to the company of his/her father in 1990, had developed a reputation for pitiless procedures of management.

"When we did not make progress with GAStech," Reynolds continued, "the chiefs of the community decided to approach the government of Kronos for the assistance.   By our policy - and with the permission of the chiefs of Elodis - we published the test results in an official public document.  The chiefs of Elodis then approached the civils servant of government as citizens of a community of Kronesian armed with the scientific analysis.  Our agency ensured that we would be still available to help in some way when these agreements were completed. "?

In this moment Mrs. Reynolds was called part of the telephone, thus I returned to my friend of writer, Pondo Reese for saying to completion the history.

WHO ARE the PROTESTERS 



2012/08/24


ABILA, Kronos - with the third birthday of the approach of died of Elan Carol - former member of the guards of Kronos - the question is: who are the protesters? But not only which is they, which and why they protest? 



The guards of Kronos or POK were founded in 1997 by residents of rural Elodis in accordance with the opinion of now old health for all (WFA), an international group of safety of water. The POK was launched to give the attention to the clean questions of water surrounding Elodis to the government of Kronos and of the world. The POK affirms that the site of international natural gas drilling of curve of GAStech Tiskele is the source from both the contamination of drinking water as well as the destruction of the traditional fields surrounding Elodis. 



In 1998, WFA carried out test on the water of Elodis finding the levels high of benzene, arsenic of toluene and xylene, barium, chromium, lead and selenium. The test of a following report/ratio released by an attention and pressure on the international government and GAStech brought by WFA to the act. However, with reducing WFA in fragments due to the questions of placement, the requests of the POK were mainly ignored and reduced the value. 



Moreover in 1998, Juliana Vann, one ten years previously healthy - the old maid died of a prolonged disease, which WFA-a placed of the claimed doctors was caused by contamination of water. The government of Kronos officially refuted the complaint quoting the fragmentation of the organization of WFA like obviousness of a dubious source not to make confidence. Without worrying, Juliana was well to the martyrdom of the POK first and employed the image of Juliana on the literature of countryside since. 



The martyrdom in the second place principal of POK is Elan Carol, which died in 2009 while imprisoned unspecified causes. The POK affirms it was stopped above trumped to the top of the expenses while the government of Kronos it question was a radical activist and violent one occupied in tax avoidance. Carol had been implied POK since its beginning since his/her father, Jeroen Carol, were an original member.  The death of Elan Carol in 2009 was marked for spontaneous examples of protest around Abila. The birthday of its death, June 19, saw protests, demonstrations, riots, and violence additional. 



The POK evolved/moved of the peaceful protests and the demonstrations requiring the action of government to more violent activities including/understanding riots while they claim that the government made little with nothing by addressing the contamination, the intoxications, and the deaths suffered by their people. In date of 2011, the government of Kronos marked the POK like "threatens public".</docText>

The gas and oil industry of Kronos informed that it takes up its "greater challenge in 20 years" of due to the bottom grades of exploration.



2012/02/21


The civils servant of energy of government declared that only 15 wells were drilled last year.

It was in spite of the strong levels of the investment, reaching one year last record and supported this year.

The structural test drilling was in fall of 26 wells six years ago, only sufficiently to recover a fraction of estimated oil and to poison remaining in the countries oil and of the gas layers.

The "fields of Kronos contain an abundance of oil and the gas to be still found and it is critical find us the means of turning the current state of the exploration around" - of the Minister for energy Jules Jecovic

The annual investigation of activity per Oil and gas Kronos found last year an increase fast in production costs, to the top from 15%.

The average cost to extract a barrel from oil was in rise of 27% in only year, to reach K17.

The number of fields with the cost by barrel above K30 doubled in the last 12 months.

Increasing costs were quoted last week by GAStech, which considers future investments in Norway and North America, rather than the fields of Kronos.

With increasing costs, one expects that payments of taxes of production to the treasure of Kronos fall from K3.5bn during 2011-12 in K2bn per current year.

After the fast decline in the production of oil and gas starting from the fields of Kronos these last years, the rate of fall slowed down during 2012 - to the bottom of barrels of 8% with oil .83m per day, or its equivalents of gas.

To continue to read the principal history	

Fields "of Kronos indicated by Jecovic contain an abundance of oil and the gas to be still found and it is critical find us the means of turning the current state of exploration around. The availability and the access of equipment to the capital are the two remarkable principal barriers by our ministry."</docText>

What we know:  Police have announced that fourteen GAStech employees disappeared sometime yesterday morning.  Officials from Tethys - likely GAStech corporate officials - arrived late last night in a private jet and went directly to the Abila Police headquarters.  A fire alarm sounded at GAStech-Kronos headquarters yesterday morning at about 10:15.  No fire was identified, nor was it a bomb as some media outlets had reported.  We have no information about exactly who is missing, and are waiting for a new conference.  21 Jan 2014</docText>

UPGRADES NEEDED FOR ABILA'S DEEP WATER PORT

19 September 1993

ABILA, Kronos - As part of the government brokered deal with GAStech International, Abila must make upgrades to their deep water port. When gas production ramps up, the Port's traffic is expected to increase ten-fold. 

The proposed upgrades include raising Abila's East Pier in phases, a massive $300 million project that will accommodate new, larger container ships. Currently the East Pier is roughly 3 meters above sea level and must be raised to 8 meters. Additionally, the Port will need to dredge the port killing two birds with one stone: increasing the depth of the port and providing fill to raise the East Pier.

Port of Abila's Director Claudio Morluniau applauded the deal saying that the additional port capacity will open doors for import and export trade. "This deal and the port expansion is the introduction of Kronos to the world!"</docText>

2009/03/09


ABILA, Kronos - the thousands of protesters carrying of the banners reading "remember Juliana!" and singing "we want the truth!" gathered in front of Kronos of government of offices Saturday morning. The protesters required an accountancy of the incomes of government then tax tax incentives of the President Araullo' S which were signed in the law in 1993.

From ten years - old man Juliana Vann died into 1998 of a disease caused by the soiled water of the operations of drilling of GAStech. It became the tearing icon of a movement which received the support of an end of Kronos to the other.

"We were promised best work, of new roads, better care of health and a better level the life," the aforementioned one 20 years - the old protestator who refused to make employ his name.  "All which I see are larger manors for the ministers and a hospital who cost the difficulty more than it can make.  We will not accept that!"

The protestator referred to the hospital general of Abila builds in 1997 seemingly with money of the increased income of the foreign gas operations here on Kronos.  The non-profit-making hospital had the difficulty of maintaining its infrastructure, in spite of the sevearl carried out by wide restoration years ago to replace the electric systems and putting balance.

"All the contracts were given to the family and the buddies ministers," shows 26 years - old man Jon L., who travelled during six hours to attend the gathering of yesterday.  "What we have need is transparency in our government.  We must know what arrives at any entering money of these alien companies.

The Chief Elian Karel of protest addressed the demonstrators to the park of town of Abila.  Karel ensured the control of POK of Henk Bodrogi, whose bad health forced to the bottom of the position.  Karel spoke by eloquence about the beginnings about the countryside about POK like effort about bases for clean water, with the dynamic movement it has become demanding improved transparency and the responsibility for government.

"We do not ask anything not very reasonable," Karel speaks passion?ment with its burning listeners.  "Very that we want is of knowing our taxes are employed.  We know that these companies produce benefit of discs at the expense of Kronos, but we let us not see any the promised improvements of it.  Very that we want is responsibility for those which died because of avarice, the corruption and the negligence of those that they should protect."

Calls to the office of the president were not immediately turned over.</docText>

TISKELE BEND EXPLOSION AND FIRE 

 

2000/08/17
 

ABILA, Kronos - A spark at the GAStech International-owned well at the Tiskele Bend site ignited methane gas several hundred feet underground, causing a fireball and fire that burned for about an hour is the findings from a dual GAStech - government investigation of the explosion and subsequent fire Sunday morning.  

 

Four GAStech employees suffered injuries including minor burns and broken bones. No local residents were injured as well and though some residents of Elodis were evacuated from their homes the investigation indicates that the evacuation was unnecessary.  

 

While the official cause of the explosion is still under investigation, the problem may have come from a defect in the wellhead itself. GAStech's wellheads are ringed with collars that have set pins running through them.</docText>

1621 - I caught up with another employee exiting the area.  She told me the police were questioning everyone.  I asked her if she'd seen anything usual.  "There were some people I didn't recognize, but I didn't get really close.  I work on the second floor and only saw them through the glass elevator."  When asked if they could have been kidnappers, she told me she shouldn't say anything else and that the police told them to not talk to anyone. 20 Jan 2014</docText>

ELIAN KAREL DEAD IN KRONOS JAIL
Petrus Gerhard
19 June 2009

ABILA, Kronos -Elian Karel, age 28, died Friday while unlawfully incarcerated at the Abila City Prison.  Karel was being held on fraudulent tax evasion charges after his arrest on March 12 earlier this year.
His attorney, Michale Kraft made the announcement Friday during a noon press conference.
"We don't know any details yet.  What I can tell you is that when I left Elian yesterday after meeting with him in the prison he was in excellent health and good spirits.  He was expecting to be released in the next few days and return to his work with the Protectors of Kronos, and was excited to continue the Protectors of Kronos mission to which he dedicated his life.  I can assure you that Elian's death will be investigated with all the resources at our disposal and those responsible will be brought to justice."
Supporters of the POK and others began gathering outside the police station as news spread.
"I can't believe it," Kriste Brontes said through her tears, "We were at the rally in March.  He looked and sounded so good.  He was so optimistic that changes were coming.  Who will be able to lead POK now?"
Karel, from Elodis, had been involved with the POK mission since he was young.  He was only a few years older than Juliana Vann, a friend who died in 1998 of toxin poisoning caused by illegal dumping from the Tethyn company GAStech. 
Calls to the President's office, the office of the Minister of Justice and the office of the Chief of Police were not immediately returned.</docText>

GAStech developed the innovating technique of drilling in 1974 was completely crowned success for the extraction of gas, but the incidences on the environment of the technique are considered unacceptable by the government of Tethys due to the high probability of the contamination of table of water starting from the waste produced during the process of HASR.

Centrum's central role in the Tethan Gas Industry  

 

1982/10/02
 

The world of gas is distant, difficult and far flung. In Tethys a few years ago, I journeyed laboriously to the remote gas fields of Tethys to look at a contentious new energy producing area. 

One of the sites I visited was a local office of the Sanjorge Gas company, crammed with reinforced work boots and overalls and the chemicals and supplies you need to run a gas operation. 

But I'd forgotten about the encounter until I went back to Tethys the other day for the first time since their early years, to reacquaint with the man who created the business, Sten Sanjorge: one man (one of the richest individuals in Tethys) who has lived through the whole story of gas prospecting and prospered mightily from it. 

But as I went round the capital city of Centrum interviewing people, I soon realised that this was not just a story of new energy. Something very significant has happened to turn Centrum into a global centre of gas industry expertise. It then seemed a pretty impossible dream, turning an island of coal into a place with abundant oil and gas supplies. 

It seemed to us on the west coast of Scotland that the far flung city of Centrum, Tethys was getting a bit big for its boots, starting to believe in a new fantasy industry. 

By the early 1970s, a new gas company, GAStech, began its juggernaut-like advances. 

Under his canny guidance, GAStech evolved into a major supplier of natural gas to the local region, and then much further afield.  You notice them in the constant clutter of helicopters to-ing and fro-ing out to remote areas, and the planes lined up at the city's airport to shuttle execs back and forth from the city. But Sanjorge has just been asked to produce a report for the Tethan government recommending the best ways of ensuring that Tethys continues to produce energy for decades to come. 

The easy-to-get stuff has been produced, so keeping the gas coming will need much investment and more clever new techniques, such as the hyper-acidic substrate removal techniques developed by the company in 1974.  

So thanks to clever people such as Sten Sanjorge and the people who work with him, Centrum has achieved what every place where raw materials are discovered longs to do. The city has taken the temporary boon of energy on its doorstep, and turned it into specialized knowledge and intellectual property which may make Centrum a centre of gas expertise long after the gas itself runs out.</docText>

According to Danisliau, the seven or eight passengers of the first plane were "business types" and appeared to be in a hurry. It was not exactly clear where they were headed. The plane took off around 12:30 local Kronos time. 

The second plane also carried seven or eight "business types", but seemed "much more relaxed than the first group of passengers". Danisliau said the second group of passengers "seemed to be celebrating something." The second plane departed around 14:30 around two hours after the first plane.

Danisliau confirmed that the second plane's destination was Rome, Italy.

Between the two private jets that departed the Abila Airport fourteen to sixteen people could have been passengers. This could easily account for the leadership of GAStech - Kronos. 

When asked whether or not the two planes had anything to do with GAStech International Danisliau replied, "I don't ask a lot questions. I just fuel the planes."</docText>

2009/02/21
 

CENTRUM, Tethys - An official statement released by Sten Sanjorge, Jr. President and CEO of GASTech International, condemns the Protectors of Kronos as both an "illegitimate" and a "terrorist" organization. The statement came in response to a Wednesday's protest rally by the POK at the GAStech - Kronos headquarters. 

 

Roughly 200 people gathered in front of the GAStech building chanting slogans and waving signs alleging people have died due the results of contamination from a GAStech drilling site. responded to the claims of GAStech contamination saying, "We [GAStech] have worked tirelessly to meet - if not exceed - the international health standards agreed upon with the Government of Kronos prior to any and all drilling." 

 

Ten POK protesters chained themselves to the door of GAStech - Kronos barring entry to the building. lays out his argument, "If a person is willing to trespass on private property, if a person is willing to chain himself to a door to prevent a business from operating, if a person is willing to break windows and burn cars in his own city, then that person is willing to do anything. And if a person is willing to do anything to accomplish their end goal than they strike fear in the common citizen.</docText>

GASTECH LEADERSHIP CONFIRMED MISSING
By Haneson Ngohebo
20 January 2014

ABILA, Kronos - Miriam Avila, an administrative assistant at GAStech International, has confirmed that members of the GAStech leadership are in fact missing. The group was expected to arrive at the Government reception following this morning's meeting at GAStech - Kronos headquarters, but never showed up.

Ms. Avila denied that any GAStech employee has been abducted. She also denied that they had simply skipped town with their newfound riches.

As The World reported on 16 December 2013, GAStech International's recent initial public offering (IPO) netted Sten Sanjorge, Jr. an eye-popping $1.96 billion for his controlling share of the international gas drilling and exploration company. 

The GAStech - Kronos leadership was also handsomely rewarded. The IPO filings show that the executive group earned a collective $327.25 million from the newly vested shares including $96.25 million each for CFO Ingrid Barranco, CIO Ada Campo-Corrente, and COO Orhan Strum. Environmental Safety Advisor Willem Vasco-Pais also earned $38.5 million.

Though Mr. Sanjorge, Jr. maintains an office in Centrum, the capital of Tethys, most of GAStech International's operations take place on Kronos including production of about 5 million cubic meters of gas daily. Ms. Avila works in GAStech's Centrum headquarters.</docText>

27 July 2011

ABILA, Kronos - The Kronos Government has labeled the Protectors of Kronos (POK) as a threat to the public. In a statement by government spokesman Rufus Drymiau the POK are described as "justifiably a public threat due to violent demonstrations, opportunistic vandalism, and clashes with the police."

A shop owner in the Siopa district, who declined to be named, responded to the government labeling the POK a public threat: "I agree they are a public threat. Every time they come around they bring their signs and then they smash windows. We try to fight, but there are too many and they steal our things. My business suffers because of the Protectors."

Officer Emilio Haber, who patrols the Siopa district, said of the POK, "They smash the windows. They throw the rocks. They chant for change and paint things on buildings. They make themselves look stupid and then we arrest them and put them in jail where they belong."</docText>

Total trunks of charity of drain of disasters



1999/11/15
The new calls fact countryside on the horizon to maintain the liquidity.

The agencies of assistance informed that the monetary needs and for food increased in the whole world and that they can not be able to satisfy the basic needs.

The Office of UNO for the coordination of the humane businesses indicates that 15 million people remain requiring the essential goods and the services, because the number and the severity of crises had like consequence a lack of "food, care of health, and access to the lives."

A new group of assistance, Singapore WORRYING was recently made up in response to the conflict in Kosovo.  Dr. Jayala Mahmed could not find an organization existing to finance it to offer his medical departments there.  Singapore WORRYING sent five missions to Kosovo to provide the mobile medical care.  They also launched an effort of collection of funds in collaboration with the governments of Malaysia.  "We are held ready to help, but it is difficult to find placement," Dr. indicated Mahmed. "Is so necessary but so much was already spent."

Thirteen people were wounded Tuesday in Izmit, Turkey, because people attacked a convoy of relief of government, civils servant known as.  One fears completely approximately 20.000 people in the two earthquakes which occurred this year.  Singapore WORRYING dispatched teams of relief in Turkey.

However, of the organizations of assistance are stretched with their limits.  Health for all the medical teams helped of ad hoc help during the earthquake of September in central Taiwan which measured 7.3 on the scale of Richter.  "The answer of the rescue squads was impressive, but not coordinated," stated a health for all the spokesman.  "We were never sure if we were directed to the most desperate places.  We soon missed medicines and funds to support our teams of assistance and had to turn over to the house."

 THE WHO BRINGS A WEAPON TO SEATING INSIDE?



2013/06/22


ABILA, Kronos - yesterday, because they have each 19 of June by last the three years of those in favor of the reunited protectors of Kronos demanding much just as they are in the last fourteen years old:  a end to the corruption of the officials of the government of Kronos and the cleaning of the toxic sweepings unloads that it has become the river of Tiskele near Elodis. 

The meeting that happened in several places through the city, including in front of publically-had home of president Kapelou and the capital building of Abila.  The citizens collected to hope that their voices would be heard by their chosen civil employees. They distributed the information on the printed aviators and donated by local businesses on the incongruencias of the form of life between the chosen civil employees of today and he does of some years. The demonstrators maintained the posters of martyrs of POK and sang for the social and economic parity, whereas the members black-had with the police of Abila formed lines faceless of the protectors, the command batons and the lateral arms surrounding to the crowds.

On each one the mind was the question:   Who brings a weapon to a Pacific feels inside?  The meeting had been published like pacific meeting of citizens to bring its preoccupations to the public sense.  The most dangerous article of its hands was a picture dead girl sweet-faced of ten years of old - a Julian Vann that died in 1998 of the cancer caused by the benzene in its potable water.  

 So that the government of Kronos felt the necessity to send to police squadron of the gross one?

In spite of these severe efforts, as the people groups slid through the barricades and they moved through the streets to bring his message to the citizens of Kronos.  The aviators who brought messages of the truth and justice were lazy in banks of the park, caf'es and slight posts.  

 How can these civil employees - hypothetical obtaining close in pays public - be allowed the second the great homes, boats and the automobiles of luxury that boast of?</docText>

2014/01/20
 

ABILA, Kronos - A long tense day of conflicting reports and confusing information has come to an end. What we know for certain is that 14 GAStech employees are not only missing, but kidnapped as confirmed by a Kronos Government source.

1520 UPDATE - A report from the Abila Airport indicates that a private plane departed with eight people around 2:30 PM. The chartered jet was reportedly headed towards Rome, Italy. This report appears to confirm earlier rumors that members of the GAStech leadership simply avoided reporters and the Government reception.
GAStech employees have begun to exit the building. Hopefully they will shed light on today's events.</docText>

POK REMEMBERS MARTYRED LEADER 

 

2012/06/20
 

ABILA, Kronos - In a touching ceremony Wednesday leaders of the activist group Protectors of Kronos paid tribute to their fallen leader, Elian Karel, who was murdered on 19 June 2009 while being illegally detained in a Kronos jail. 

"Today we gather to remember Elian Karel," Silvia Marek told the rapt assembly, many of whom held up white candles in Karel's honor. 

"Elian was born on an Elodis farm not 40 minutes from here, to Jeroen and Antaura Karel.   By the time Elian was 17 many of his family members and friends were battling constant illness, including his neighbor 10-year old Juliana Vann." 

"Elian devoted his life to the people of Elodis as well as all citizens of Kronos, as did his father before him.  Elian knew his would be a difficult journey.  He had watched his father, Jeroen and the founder of the POK, Henk Bodrogi walk the very path he would tread.  Elian knew the course would not be easy, and would leave little time for a personal life. 

"Elian's journey ended three years ago today. 

Over the course of the afternoon several other speakers paid tribute to not only Elian, but all who have been victims of the environmental catastrophe brought about by greed and corruption of public officials.  The police agitated many of the crowd, causing them to have to leave the assembly rather than be assailed with batons and pepper spray.</docText>

ABILA, Kronos - The healthy water awareness group, Wellness for All (WFA), has condemned both GAStech International and the Government of Kronos.

However, GAStech International's Environmental Safety Advisor Ingmar Casablancas responded to the claims, "The alleged charges levied against GAStech International are unfounded.

ELODIS, KRONOS:  A TOWN IN NEED, Part One
Petrus Gerhard
19 March 1998

This article is the first installment of a three-part series addressing the growing problem of one community's anguish, government malfeasance, and the alarming influence of multinational corporations on the country of Kronos.
ELODIS, Kronos - Nestled in the bend of the Tiskele River, the sun rises over the farming town of Elodis,  chasing away the shadows cloaking nearby Mt. Bouro.  Today, as they have every day for over 250 years, residents will rise to tend the rich floodplain land that provides nourishment for the People of Kronos.
Two weeks prior I received an email from an old friend, Pondo Reese, now the editor of the Elodis Weekly Journal, an agriculture paper serving the community around Tiskele Bend. In his email he described a once bountiful region now distressed by contamination, struggling to find solutions to a worsening problem.  I decided to investigate.
"We didn't make the connection at first," Reese told me when I met with him at his office.  "The gas company had been built a few years back in '94, and our problems didn't start right away.   After a couple of harvests, we saw a decline in the production.   We thought perhaps it was just a hiccup, and things would get better.  Then when the kids started getting sick we took a harder look at what could have changed."
The change turned out to be GAStech International, an international corporation run by Sten Sanjorge Jr, a business tycoon out of Tethys.
Established in 1961, the GAStech corporation began as a family-owned business providing local trucking services in Tethys.  The two founders - Sten Sanjorge Sr and Hank Fluss - found wildcat drilling to be more lucrative, and thus began a series of environmental disasters and financial scandals that eventually ran Sanjorge Sr into an early grave and drove Fluss into a marginal role in his own company.  With the death of Sanjorge Sr, the son took the helm of GAStech firmly in his grasp and broadened its influence further afield, eventually landing at the doorstep of the small peaceful township of Elodis.
With a population of 6500, most residents of Elodis live in one- and two-story houses on small farms.  A smaller number of families live in the township along a main street with two markets, two hardware stores, one gas station and a caf? where you can buy lunch, pick up your mail and purchase a litre of milk to bring home.  Families have lived in Elodis for generations.
"We've made a good living for a long time," Reese tells me. "The population has been steadily increasing.  Crop production has been good.  For the most part, kids haven't left for the city as they have in a lot of other rural places.  We have a lot of land that could yet be developed. There was a future for them here."
I asked Reese to help me meet the people whose lives have been impacted by GAStech's operations.  He introduced me to a farmer whose family had been here for several generations.  
I caught up with Henk Bodrogi in town making purchases at the Osvaldo hardware store to repair a broken tractor.  Bodrogi has farmed soybeans his entire life, as did his father and their fathers. I asked him about his life on the farm.

Interpol announced the formation of a new working group of multi-country to fight the increasingly broad distribution of the cathinone of methyldimethyl of drug (MDMC).  To direct the working group is an elder inspector Robert Loblaw, a leader of veteran who carried out the very successful team of Tethys Counterdrug.  It is optimistic that it can identify the source.



"These drugs of originator have certain indices as for their origin," Loblaw says times in an interview.  "Each time the receipt is changed, it leaves indices as for which made.  It is like a pedigree."



This particular mixture of the drug MDMC, also known by its street calls the "cotton sugar refinery", the "spice dreams" and the "flower of tulip", was found previously only in Asteria but made its manner with the streets of Tethys and other international countries.



"I will look at hard the activities of the popular army of Asterian," Loblaw known as.  "Our preceding investigations moved to them like source of this particular formulation."



The popular army of Asterian (APA) is a paramilitary organization which was committed in activities of terrorist placed by his criminal companies, which include the traffic of drug.  These last years the APA sought to establish their mark by Web sites and the publication of a professional store and high quality called "Arise".



The elder inspector Loblaw says the public statistics of Tethys indicate that MDMC is a problem growing with the youth of the country.  "An increase in the problems of mental health, including the hallucinations and paranoia, accompanied by the violent behavior and an increase marked in the rates of suicide are only some of the indicators of the use of this drug of originator."



"We initially alerted the left civils servant to be on the monitoring for suspicious forwardings of insecticides and cleaning product, the two similar ones in the aspect to MDMC."</docText>

GASTECH TRUCK HITS AUTOMOBILE NEAR ELODIS, FAMILY OF FOUR DEAD 
Maha Salo
20 March 2007

ELODIS, Kronos - A vehicle collision claimed the lives of an Elodis family, including two children Tuesday afternoon.  The family was traveling home from a school program where one of the children had performed in the Spring Program at Elodis Primary School.

Elodis Assistant Police Commissioner Adian Koppolis reported three of the victims died at the scene of the accident.  Marcellus Edris, 33, his wife Valeria, 30, their daughter Celia, 7 died at the scene of the accident.  A son, Carmine, survived the initial collision but died later at an Abila hospital.

The unidentified 25-year old driver of the GAStech truck was held overnight in the Elodis city jail, and then released.

Initial reports from the investigators state the truck driver had illegally entered the intersection where he had failed to halt at a stop sign, while the other vehicle had the right of way.

Commissioner Koppolis said Elodis police would conduct a full investigation.</docText>

POK LEADER KAREL ARRESTED 

 

2009/03/12
 

ABILA, Kronos ?????? In another unconscionable move against the citizens of Kronos, earlier today police arrested POK leader Elian Karel on spurious tax evasion charges. 

Demonstrating his trademark humor, Karel lifted his wrists and joked to his supporters as he is led away, ??????I guess I shouldn??????t have sent the President those cases of bottled water for his birthday.?????? 

Karel is the leader of the Protectors of Kronos, an alliance of Kronos citizens from Elodis that has demanded the government clean up the contaminated water caused by gas drilling in their community. 

??????We didn??????t ask for GAStech to come to our community,?????? Karel spoke at a rally a few months ago.  Neither Elodis nor the people of Kronos have received any benefit from the extraordinarily large amount of money that GAStech clears every year.  I ask:  Where is the money going??????? 

The police representative assured supporters who massed outside the police station that Karel would be treated humanely, but declined to answer questions or allow visitors to see Karel.  He??????ll probably complain about the jail food at the next POK rally.??????  

Kraft plans to meet with Karel Saturday morning.</docText>

1235 UPDATE - Rumors abound in regards to the potentially missing GAStech executives. Some suggest that the newly vested executive group skipped the government reception to avoid the press and left to an unknown resort location to celebrate their recent windfall.
However, this rumor does not explain the police presence nor does it explain the fire department's search of GAStech headquarters.</docText>

LACK OF DETAILS MARS GOVERNMENT INTENTIONS
Petrus Gerhard
2 February  1993


ABILA, Kronos - In a glitzy press conference late last year President Luis Araullo announced a historic set of tax incentives intended to bring foreign investment to Kronos under the guise creating jobs, providing cheap energy and building infrastructure.  Following the 86-14 vote last month the Minister of the Interior Tomas Sarto lauded the decision as "landmark" and "bettering the people".
We shall see.  The crafters of these revolutionary measures neglected to include a detailed plan about how this windfall would benefit everyday Kronosians.  When the first payment from these foreign company lands in the state coffers, how will these funds be dispersed?
One wonders:  Did the 14 who opposed the measure feel the same way?  Were they also wondering exactly how this money would be funneled into education, improvements in roads, utilities and healthcare?
Calls to the offices of the President were not returned.</docText>

ARRESTED MEMBERS POK



2001/09/02


ELODIS, Kronos - government heavies obstructed the free speech - once again - of members of the guards of the activist group of Kronos yesterday at a legitimate demonstration at the areas of bending Tiskele.  The five activists POK had collected themselves for the poorten to GAStech facility of gas the drill far directions to bring Tiskele public information concerning the polluted river which has caused health problems to the residents of Elodis.

The witnesses report that demonstration peacefully started POK with the five members were that alternating concerning the way run, chanting remind Juliana! and no longer vergift!  

An eye told which then the poorten which are opened to permit company vehicles to GAStech moved the facility to leave aside protesters.  The witnesses are it once that tezelfdertijd the vehicles with the government of connection floated Kronos to the poorten, apparently of plan are the facility enter. 

It was going up to then, Griffith Mabel already very civil, a resident Elodis who was from POK come support told.   The opened poorten, people POK moved themselves and the freight carriages dissipated.  That is then the bizar became.  The freight carriages stopped in the middle of the way for no reason.

Another eye, Elodis farmer add Charley Normand yes, the kerels POK asked move itself the drivers neatly, but the drivers GAStech ignored them.  They had their windows, so that it was not if she could not hear them.

The occupants of the government vehicles left and dovetailed themselves the dispute.  The consecution of events becomes on this point confusing.  Some witnesses explain exhorted arguments GAStech with protestors to the drivers, and others think the government civil servants of strong weapon with protesters of the way started.

People in the government cars prove to be police force were, Mabel tell.  They wore uniforms and had kentekens.

The witnesses tell which the three parties started crying, and at what aims the police force Kronos - of Abila- arrested supposedly the five activists and transported them to a prison Elodis.

SANJORGE JR CONDEMNS POK LIKE TERRORISTS



2009/02/21


CENTRUM, Tethys - an official report/ratio released by Sten Sanjorge, president de Jr. and PRESIDENT de international GASTech, condemns the guards of Kronos like "illegitimate" and organization of "terrorist". The report/ratio came in response to the gathering from the protest from one Wednesday by the POK with the registered offices from GAStech - from Kronos.



Roughly 200 people met in front of the slogans of song of building of GAStech and the undulating signs pleading people died due the results of the contamination starting from a site of drilling of GAStech. Sanjorge, Jr. answered the complaints of the stating of contamination of GAStech, "us [GAStech] worked about it inlassablement to meet - if not exceed - with the international standards of health agreed upon with the government of Kronos before and all drilling."



Ten protesters of POK were connected with the door of GAStech - Kronos except the entry with the building. 



In Sanjorge prolonged of report/ratio Jr. present its argument, "if a person is laid out with enfreindre on the private property, if a person is been willing to be connected with a door to prevent businesses from then operating, if a person is been willing to break windows and to burn cars in her own city, this person is been willing to do anything. And if a person is been willing to do anything to achieve their goal of end which they run up against fear in the common citizen. I fear what they will do after because I fear of what they are able. When a group of people employ fear and violence to achieve their goals of end there is only one word for them and this word is terrorist."



The report/ratio concludes with Sanjorge, Jr. requiring that the government of the whole of Kronos ensure until "not only the safety of my employees, but all citizens of Kronos."</docText>

WRAP UP OF EVENTS AT GASTECH 

 

2014/01/20
 

ABILA, Kronos - A long tense day of conflicting reports and confusing information has come to an end. What we know for certain is that 14 GAStech employees are not only missing, but kidnapped as confirmed by a Kronos Government source. At this time it is unclear who the missing are and whether they are citizens of Kronos of Tethys, as many GAStech employees are Tethan. Speculation about the motives of the kidnappers has been rampant due to the recent news of the GAStech Initial Public Offering only a month ago. Edvard Vann, a GAStech - Kronos security guard who was interrogated and released after 6 hours, gave the indication that the Protectors of Kronos were involved or at least suspected as being the perpetrators behind today's events. 

 

A GAStech International senior security executive has been on site to support the investigation aiding the Abila Police Department and Kronos Government officials. Shortly after the morning meeting ended at 10:00, Abila Fire Department trucks responded to reports of a fire at the GAStech office.</docText>

Government Strikes Deal with GAStech International
Donato Petri
12 March 1993

ABILA, Kronos - President Araullo today announced the signing of an agreement between his government and the Tethys-based GAStech International for the development of the Tiskele Bend gas fields.  GAStech, under the leadership of visionary Sten Sanjorge Jr., was awarded exclusive rights to drill in the government-owned fields after agreeing to the government's request that 50% or more of the workforce be Kronosian citizens.  President Araullo hailed the landmark deal as "the beginning of a new era for our great country, an era of opportunity and fortune for all."  Our sources at the Ministry of Interior tell us that the 50% tax levied on new oil and gas exploration could yield in excess of $1 billion in tax revenue per year.  This will allow the government to make unprecedented investments into infrastructure, health care, and education.</docText>

TISKELE BEND EXPLOSION AND FIRE

16 August 2000

ABILA, Kronos - A spark at the GAStech International-owned well at the Tiskele Bend site ignited methane gas several hundred feet underground, causing a fireball and fire that burned for about an hour is the findings from a dual GAStech - government investigation of the explosion and subsequent fire Sunday morning. 

Four GAStech employees suffered injuries including minor burns and broken bones. In contrast to previous reports there were no deaths and none missing as a result of the incident. No local residents were injured as well and though some residents of Elodis were evacuated from their homes the investigation indicates that the evacuation was unnecessary. 

While the official cause of the explosion is still under investigation, the problem may have come from a defect in the wellhead itself. GAStech's wellheads are ringed with collars that have set pins running through them. One of the pins may have blown out of the collar, releasing the gas, which then came in contact with a spark.</docText>

POK SE POINTS OUT THE CHIEF OF MARTYRED



2012/06/22


ABILA, Kronos - in the chiefs moving one Wednesday of ceremony of the guards of group of activist of Kronos poured the homage on their fallen chief, Elian Karel, which was assassinated on June 19, 2009 while being illegally held in prison of Kronos.

"Today we meet to point out Elian Karel to us," Silvia Marek said the enthumansiaste, much which delayed the white candles in the honor of Karel.

"Elian was constant with a farm of Elodis not 40 minutes from here, in Jeroen and Antaura Karel.  It grew with the spectrum of dead all around him.   Before Elian was 17 several of its members of family and the friends fought the constant disease, including its neighbor 10 years - old man Juliana Vann. "?

Marek made a pause one moment to allow the cries of "remember Juliana!" to fade.

"Elian devoted its life to the people of Elodis as well as all the citizens of Kronos, just as his/her father before him.  Elian knew that his would be a difficult voyage.  It had observed his father, Jeroen and the founder of the POK, walk of Henk Bodrogi the way even as it would go.  Elian knew that the course would not be easy, and would leave little time during a personal life.  However it chose to take these measurements in spite of the challenges which it knew that it would face."

The "voyage of Elian finished three years ago of today.  But its dream did not die with him.  And it is this vision of healthy and future thrives for all we are here today to honor."

In afternoon several other loudspeakers paid homage not only to Elian, but all what were victims of the environmental catastrophe caused by avarice and corruption of the public civils servant. 

The gathering was disturbed only by the presence of aggravation of the police force of Abila in the speed of riot.  The police force agitated much crowd, involving them to have to leave the assembly rather than to be invaded with the sticks and the jet of pepper.</docText>

RELATED HALTINGS DRUG IN THE ASCENT

 

2011/05/16


ABILA, Kronos - a new alarming tendency is sweeping Abila. The police needs a dramatic increase in the related haltings drug that can be bound to the violent groups of the activist. 



The port of Abila is known to be a point of the transfer for the drugs that come from the Middle East and of Africa that go to the heroin and the hashish of Europe that is to say. Nevertheless, the drug related haltings had continued being flat on the last decade until the recent increase. 



The preoccupations by the increase of related haltings drug are double: first, the violent groups of the activist such as the protectors of Kronos could use sales of the drug like means to finance their activities; and secondly, with more drugs appearing in the border, the people of Kronos will undergo increasing related editions drug, that is to say attachment and violence.</docText>

    <docText>Homeland Illumination
POK MEMBERS ARRESTED
Petrus Gerhard
31 August 2001

ELODIS, Kronos - Government heavies obstructed the free speech - yet again - of members of the activist group Protectors of Kronos yesterday at a lawful demonstration at the Tiskele Bend fields.  The five POK activists had gathered in front of the gates to GAStech gas drilling operations facility to bring public awareness about the polluted Tiskele River which has caused health problems to the residents of Elodis.
Bystanders report that the demonstration had begun peacefully with the five POK members walking back and forth across the road, chanting "Remember Juliana!" and "No more poison!"  
An eyewitness told the Homeland Illumination that when the gates opened to allow GAStech company vehicles to exit the facility the protesters moved aside.  Witnesses agree that at the same time vehicles with the Government of Kronos seal drove to the gates, apparently planning to enter the facility. 
"It was all very civil up till then," Griffith Mabel, an Elodis resident who had come out to support the POK told the Homeland Illumination.   "The gates opened, the POK people moved and the trucks drove out.  That's when it got weird.  The trucks stopped in the middle of the road for no reason."
Another eyewitness, Elodis farmer Charley Normand adds, "Yeah, the POK guys asked the drivers to move nicely, but the GAStech drivers ignored them.  They had their windows down, so it wasn't like they couldn't hear them."
The occupants of the government vehicles exited and joined the altercation.  The sequence of events becomes confusing at this point.  Some witnesses state the GAStech drivers instigated arguments with the protestors, and others think the government officials began to strong arm the protesters from the road.
"Turns out the people in the government cars were police," Mabel tells the Homeland Illumination.  "They wore uniforms and had badges."
Onlookers tell the Homeland Illumination that the three parties began yelling, and at some point the Kronos police - presumably from Abila-  arrested the five activists and transported them to an Elodis jail.
Despite repeated requests for an interview, the Homeland Illumination has not been granted access to those arrested.</docText>

Penetration of an expert: prospering like foreign CEO in Kronos 

2014/03/26
17 of January of 1995



The Fluss hank is CEO of GAStech, main industry of Krono by more than 15 years, after its discovery of its immense gas fields near the city of Elodis.

Fluss, has worked with dozens of foreign CEOs on the years. Nevertheless, it has humble principles like prospector of the oil and the gas in Tethys. 

He spoke to the times on the characteristics of a leader guessed right in Kronos and what foreign CEOs can hope in the market. 

Q:  What can foreign CEOs wait for when it comes to Kronos?

A: The economic atmosphere has changed from years 80. He is much more hard to be successful today. Foreign necessity of CEOs to play under its expectations. There are no easy triumphs in Kronos. The foreign competition between Kronosian and companies are resistant. It is difficult to gain the hearts and the minds of the population.

But there is less difference than people think between the culture of Kronosian and, culture of Tethian of the opinion. The personnel of Kronos works hardly like hardly, she is respectful of her work and has he himself desire for the success. Also they know to appreciate to the efficient communication and a talented leader.

What foreign leader needs to do it is to learn how to communicate the "way of Kronosian" and to take time to understand its personnel.

Q:  Can you elaborate?

A: There are many cultural differences in communicating. [Considerar] the notes. Foreign CEOs always confused and is frustrated when somebody in Kronos sends a note [] and counts on a simple answer of yes/no. In place they obtain a very long answer that it does not answer its initial question.

The people of Kronos do not have taste to take responsibility. They scare it to lose his works and she does not have taste of being forced in saying something that it does not wish a. Foreign necessity of CEOs to take this in consideration and to need to take the time to understand how to communicate.

The patience is key. The transparency can be an excellent way to obtain around this. It is an European value that Kronosians is very responsivo a. The imposition of him in a company can make the trip of a foreign CEO in Kronos a much more pleasant experience.

Q:  Which is the challenges of the pipe a foreign CEO can do in front on arrival in Kronos?



A: It is sometimes the simplest things that they can be desafiadoras, like obtaining of A to B in a taxi. The power to obtain around is taken easily for granted and not being able to do so it creates a great sense of the insecurity. In Kronos you never are safe if his conductor falls to him dull in the feasible line. This can look like as a small edition but on a daily base is very annoying.

Another one is becoming familiar with its equipment and with whom you are working. The often foreign right of the passage of CEOs of the plane and in an office completely of the fellow workers of Kronos. They do not have any idea that is, how they work or how they are described are. This can be confused. 



Q:  Can you give some extremities in how a foreign CEO can prepare yourself?

A: The first thing that would say is to prepare its family. They can find it difficult to adapt to the new surroundings of work. This can affect personal life. The family and the work who mix themselves are practical very common here. The people of Kronos work in extra hours and socialize with her colleagues. It is very different from Tethys where there is a clear limit between the work and the family.

Foreign CEOs must also make how he is resistant is the competition and how much hard work must be put inside to be successful -- often much more that in its countries of origin. The language is a great edition.

[But] does not concern you at the most is prepared, the true experience of the work and to live in Kronos it will always surprise to him.

Q:  How difficult - or easy - is to being a foreign CEO in Kronos?

A: Generally, I think that being a CEO he is hard. There are many of pressure, the atmosphere is resistant and is difficult to find a balance with its personal life.

When an equipment of hears them to Kronos that a CEO is coming from overseas assumes is a problem. But, cultural they do not have an edition with the foreigners. 

Q:  Hay the situations in which the foreign executive being is really an advantage?

A: This question really depends on the person and how much they invest to understand the country and the culture. If they do not deliver any attack then to locate he is a net one harms. But in certain negotiations or certain editions such as luxury merchandize, foreign CEOs can be an advantage. They can bring another point of view, facilitate the process.

The foreign CEO has better knowledge of an industry and can sometimes bring the access to the overseas markets. This can be true assets.</docText>

Abila Hospitals Seeing Influx of Designer Drug Users

7 February 2013
The Emergency Department at Abila General Hospital in Kronos has been swamped in the last month by people suffering medical complications from designer drugs such as "cotton candy" and synthetic marijuana, a hospital official said.
"We have had at least two dozen cases in the last month," said Alicia Bianca, nurse manager of the department. "We are literally overwhelmed."
Bianca said she has never seen this level of activity related to drug overdoses in the seven years she has managed the Emergency Department and in the 20 years she has been a nurse.
Authorities in Abila said "cotton candy" may have been a factor in the death of 54-year-old Ralf Potter, whose bruised and naked body was found February 4 along a dead-end road. Investigators are awaiting toxicology reports to determine the cause of his death. Citywide, several deaths have been attributed to "Cotton Candy" according to the Kronos National Poison Center.
Patients are coming to Abila General from throughout the greater city region, and they include adults and youths, male and female, and all socio-economic backgrounds, Bianca said.
Sgt Antonio Arresta of the Abila Fire Department, a first-responder to emergency medical calls in the city, said his department has also seen a spike in the number of people needing treatment for complications from designer drugs. "We went from zero calls to a handful of calls" in the last month," he said.
Bianca and Arresta said their efforts to treat people is made more difficult because they often do not know anything about the designer drugs that were taken.
"You don't know what you're getting when you get it," Bianca said. "We have had patients come in and act out of control, who are very violent. They tell us they have been doing cotton candy or synthetic marijuana."
Bianca said there is little clinical data on the effects of cotton candy, as it is an emerging toxicant. "There are no controlled studies in toxicology," she said. The national poison center collects anecdotal reports on overdoses from hospitals and other providers as part of efforts to offer advice on how to treat patients.
Designer drugs are chemical compounds synthesized to resemble the active ingredient in often illegal drugs. Cotton candy mimics the drug khat, a stimulant. Manufacturers frequently change the designer drug's chemical composition and its name to stay one step ahead of authorities, Biance said. "It is another way to sell it," she said.
The term cotton candy, for example, is a nickname of the drug and has nothing to do with the carnival treat. The drug has been sold under the name of "Spice Dreams" one week and under the name of "Tulip Blossom" the next. 
The Kronos government has placed three of the chemicals commonly used in the creation of cotton candy on its controlled substance list, criminalizing their use and possession. Still, the government cannot outright ban cotton candy because manufacturers can alter the recipe and skirt the law, Bianca said. The drugs are sold online as "herbal therapy" products and are available over the counter in area stores.
"We still don't know what you are getting with cotton candy. The chemical composition varies from package to package," Bianca said.
One factor for the popularity of cotton candy is its low cost, Bianca said. She said a gram of cotton candy costs about K18 while a gram of cocaine costs K166.
Cotton candy creates euphoria, or a high, that is equal to or greater than that of cocaine but also causes a crash that is worse, Bianca said. The crash's ill-effects often prompt people to binge on cotton candy to the point where they consume the drug for days. "They crave it," she said.
After repeated use, the drug "fries" a person's brain, draining the chemicals that balance its operations. This sometimes leads to bizarre, often psychotic behavior that has been reported in the media, such as the case of the naked man in Elodis who was found running down the middle of a major highway, Bianca said. "The seizures and delusions are incredible," she said.
While it is not yet certain who is behind the distribution of this round of designer drugs, police suspect organized crime is pursuing this large income source. The Asterian People's Army has traditionally been involved with drug trafficking throughout the region, and enforcement agencies are closely examining possible cooperation between drug trafficking organizations and political insurgent groups.</docText>

Government Announces Tax Incentives For Foreign Investment
Donato Petri
18 January 1993

ABILA, Kronos - Today the Parliament voted 86 to 14 in favor of President Araullo's package of tax incentives designed to lure foreign investment to our fair country. Tomas Sarto, Minister of the Interior, lauded the vote as "a landmark deal designed to better the lives of all Kronosians".  

The tax incentives specifically target energy development companies, which the government hopes to lure to Kronos' rich, but yet undeveloped, gas fields.  Ministry of the Interior projections show that development of just the Tiskele Bend fields could bring in as many as 5,000 high paying jobs and yield billions of dollars of infrastructure development over the next 20 years.</docText>

GASTECH ADOPTS NEW LOGO 

 

2009/05/16
 

CENTRUM, Tethys - With great fanfare GAStech International's President and CEO Sten Sanjorge, Jr. spoke of the new logo - a tri-part blue flame - that is reminiscent of a leaf to "help position GAStech and its products as a clean fuel alternative."  

 

This rebranding process and new logo seem to be in response to recent trouble the multi-national gas giant has been struggling with in Kronos including the February 19 protest at GAStech - Kronos' headquarters of 200 people who blocked entrance to the building, resulting in several arrests.</docText>

GAStech 



2013/02/24


It is the largest company in Kronos, the third larger company of gas on planet, and they is years of fifty-three. In the past it had a reputation as corrupted and ambient harmful, but nowadays GAStech, the old businesses of Tethys-only, tries to gain the confidence of the international investors. This belonged to its ambitions to increase its gas of provisioning of profitable businesses apart from Mediterranean area.

It is ascending charge, and there is no certainty but Gastech with the capacity to convince the potential investors whom it repaired its manners, and is not enracin? any more in the eco-hostile past.

Operations of the drain of GAStech are based in Eastern Kronos, and there is close relationship with the government of Kronosian. It is the heart of the businesses of the drain of Kronos, where the gas of the Eastern gas layers is whistled in the west towards the remainder of Kronos, Tethys and Europe.

GAStech makes more than just gas of pump. It created cities and cities to maintain its operations, which it controls and runs almost simple-given.

The chief of GAStech, Sten Sanjorge, Jr, whose photograph fixedly looks at outside calendars and executives of table everywhere in the country, recognizes "state the charges in state", but wire-drawer owing to the fact that the needs for company simply to deal of his workmen and the communities around them.

Naturally, to populate the good reasons of the need to come and work in the areas remotely hostile of Kronosian. They are equipped with medical care, entertainment, and food. The empire of GAStech has 2 thousand cows and 3 thousand pigs in its farms of company, court of the rooms of gymnastics, and offers holidays subsidized in resources of the Black Sea for the principal employees. For executives, it runs a current situation, a medical center marble-striped and of therapy.

In addition to all these advantages, there is also the station of GAStech TV, which does not even pretend to be impartial. It is there to serve the will of the company.

This seems hardly the image of a modern total company, like the majority of those without ceremony emptied their "activities of not-core". There is an argument, however, that the businesses of energy are different from other industries, requiring companies of energy to function in the distinct ways.

By working in the distant places without average precedents infrastructure to oil and the gas sites will be always, to a certain extent, of the towns of company. GAStech tries certainly to ensure its employees can move in and out of these places by actuating a private fleet of four planes to transport out of vat its personnel the enormous distances between the sites.</docText>

ELODIS, KRONOS:  AID of one divides two of the SOURCE UNEXPECTED



1998/04/27


This article is the second installation of a series of three parts that deals with the problem every greater time an anguish of the community, the criminal fact of the government, and the alarming influence of multinational corporations in the country of Kronos.

I took for above with Henk Bodrogi in the city that made purchases in the warehouse of the hardware of Ferro to repair an broken tractor.  Bodrogi has cultivated the soybeans its whole life, like its father and his parents. I asked to him about its life in the farm.

 "We have worked the Earth during long time - perhaps 200 years, perhaps a small piece more," Henk Bodrogi said to me as it chose on a package of per to us, looking for the right size.  "On the years we have added some hectares here and there.  To us it maintains occupied."

Occupied it is an underestimation, as I found when I punctured to farmer wiry to say to me more.

 "My wife obtains the ascending cabritos and title to teach, then she will do a little something so that we eat for the lunch and we work next to me until supper.  When the children obtain school caretakers make their tasks, and we are all buttocks in the house most of the times by darkness."

"We do this most of the days," he we added, "with the exception of days of the adoration."

Bodrogi identifies the appropriate bolt and to char it with the teller on cabritos and school whereas it finishes his purchase.

"All we know one another one here," Bodrogi we explained whereas we go away. "Most of the families they have lived here for the generations.  The first new people who came to the city were with that company of the gas that constructed the posteriora part of some years."

I request Bodrogi if the business has been good. 

"We made quite good recently until time.  The benefits were good and added cultivated area, or increased the equipment.  Then we began to have all this hardship with the harvests."

How, I it requested.

"The harvests are not producing as they have in the past.  It awhile took the figure towards, outside then one of the calculated officials of the city towards outside calling in a specialist of the water.  They proved when it they said that the water was contaminated."

Bodrodgi sighed, and with a glance surrounded in its eye thanked for he me by my interest and this it had to me to direct it the back home.    I thanked for it I watched and to raise it in its car and head outside city.

The specialist of the water turned out to be the international agency "health for all", an international agency with a mission to bring the healthy water to the communities caused sorrow by natural disasters, sketch and - coincidently - oil and development of the gas.

I took for above with a representative of the health for all the following day.  Joclyn Reynolds is coordinating of the project for the "health for all".  She spoke to me on a call based on the satellites of her office of the field in Asia South-Eastern where she was efforts of the relevaci?n of the creation which they followed an earthquake. Ms Reynolds decided to speak me by some minutes between the meetings on its work in Elodis.

"A civil employee of the city on a problem we made contact with enemy whereupon they had with its local water.  In years of last agriculture one had collapsed, and the incidence of certain diseases and defects of birth had risen.  The potable water of Elodis comes from the river of Tiskele, like all the water to cultivate, so we looked for a source against the current.  We above find sources of the useless disposition of the production in &lt;km> of the operation of GAStech by waters.  The tests demonstrated to stops levels of the benzene, the tolueno, arsenic of xylene, the lead and the selenium, among other toxins. "

"These substances Can happen naturally" I asked to him.

"Not in these amounts, and not this one suddenly.  The contamination of the underground water is generally the result of the human activity.  The pipes of GAStech are sending the polluting agents in a pool.  The toxins are forming plume subsurface that leaks in the river of Tiskele of which the residents of the drainage of Elodis its potable water and irrigation for the harvests."

"You spoke with GAStech on this"

"Oh yes," she answered.  "We thought at the outset that we gained the traction.  We solved several times with the representatives of GAStech, including one of "the senior" executives, Fluss hank.  It assured personally to us that GAStech would act responsible to provide material and financial aid towards efforts of the cleaning.  After a time, although, got to be clear that whereas Mr. Fluss was serious it was Sanjorge that makes the decisions.  It is evident that it [Sanjorge] does not have any interest in the well-being of the residents of Elodis, or the atmosphere."

Sten Sanjorge, the Jr, who had inherited his part in the company of his father in 1990, had developed a reputation for the practices of business of cutthroat.

"When we did not make progress with GAStech," Reynolds continued, "the leaders of the community decided to approach the government of Kronos for the aid.   By our policy - and with the permission of the leaders of Elodis - we published the test resultses in an official public document.  The leaders of then Elodis approached the officials of the government like citizens of a community of Kronesian armed with the scientific analysis.  To our he assured them agency that we would be again available to help anyway when those agreements were concluded. "

To this point the Reynolds far from the telephone called ms, so I returned to my friend of the editor, Pondo Reese to tell to end history.

Centrum's central role in the Tethan Gas Industry 

2 October 1982

The world of gas is distant, difficult and far flung. In Tethys a few years ago, I journeyed laboriously to the remote gas fields of Tethys to look at a contentious new energy producing area.
One of the sites I visited was a local office of the Sanjorge Gas company, crammed with reinforced work boots and overalls and the chemicals and supplies you need to run a gas operation. As I remember it, a former trucker was in charge.
It was a vivid example of how a once small exploration company from Thethys had begun to grow into a mighty international force in the energy industry.
But I'd forgotten about the encounter until I went back to Tethys the other day for the first time since their early years, to reacquaint with the man who created the business, Sten Sanjorge: one man (one of the richest individuals in Tethys) who has lived through the whole story of gas prospecting and prospered mightily from it.
But as I went round the capital city of Centrum interviewing people, I soon realised that this was not just a story of new energy. Something very significant has happened to turn Centrum into a global centre of gas industry expertise. From what's developed in the capital city there are important lessons for other places blessed (and cursed) with abundant natural resources.
"Centrum developed world class expertise in engineering in very difficult surroundings"
When I was a young newspaperman on the Daily Record in Glasgow in the early 1970s, the great off-shore oil rush was beginning in the North Sea. It then seemed a pretty impossible dream, turning an island of coal into a place with abundant oil and gas supplies.
It seemed to us on the west coast of Scotland that the far flung city of Centrum, Tethys was getting a bit big for its boots, starting to believe in a new fantasy industry.
Much to his mother's regrets, meanwhile, Sten Sanjorge had started prospecting in the early 1960s.
By the early 1970s, a new gas company, GAStech, began its juggernaut-like advances.
Under his canny guidance, GAStech evolved into a major supplier of natural gas to the local region, and then much further afield. It now has thousands employees and operates in numerous countries. 
The change in Centrum has been substantial.  You notice them in the constant clutter of helicopters to-ing and fro-ing out to remote areas, and the planes lined up at the city's airport to shuttle execs back and forth from the city.
And as you drive round Centrum, almost every roundabout is sponsored by a division of GAStech. 
Sanjorge has recently started paying more attention to leisure activities and philanthropy, allowing his son Sten Jr. and co-founder Hank Fluss to run the company. But Sanjorge has just been asked to produce a report for the Tethan government recommending the best ways of ensuring that Tethys continues to produce energy for decades to come.
The easy-to-get stuff has been produced, so keeping the gas coming will need much investment and more clever new techniques, such as the hyper-acidic substrate removal techniques developed by the company in 1974. 
So thanks to clever people such as Sten Sanjorge and the people who work with him, Centrum has achieved what every place where raw materials are discovered longs to do. The city has taken the temporary boon of energy on its doorstep, and turned it into specialized knowledge and intellectual property which may make Centrum a centre of gas expertise long after the gas itself runs out.</docText>

Added Taxes on Oil, Gas Development Defeated in General Assembly  

 

2001/03/18
 

ABILA, Kronos - A motion to increase taxes on oil and gas development by an additional 10% was defeated today in the General Assembly by a vote of 77 to 23.  The proposed tax increase, championed by Minister of Health Cesare Nespola, was to provide specific funding for health care, clean water projects, and health education for rural areas.  Minister Nespola said of the Assembly vote, "I'm disappointed by the vote, but the Assembly was concerned that the increase in tax would discourage foreign investment in our energy sector.  Additionally, I will work with President Kapelou's office to restructure the allocation of funds from current gas and oil taxes to provide for rural health projects."</docText>

When she left her home in Elodis, Kronos - a rural township outside the capital Abila - to investigate the noise she noticed a large fire coming from GAStech International's Tiskele Bend site. At least four GAStech employees appeared to have been taken away by ambulance; however, GAStech has declined to comment on the extent and nature of their injuries.  

 

GAStech's CEO Sten Sanjorge Jr. downplayed the event stating, "This event could hardly be described as an explosion," but merely a common practice referred to as flaring.  

 

Mrs. Cato and other locals from Elodis were turned away by GAStech employees and government officials. Rebecca Cato said, "After sending us away without a single question answered, they came to our doors and told us to leave our homes.</docText>

Protest Turns Violent in Abila
Marcella Trapani
20 June 2009

ABILA, Kronos - A rally of hundreds of protestors allied with the "Protectors of Kronos" movement turned to violence today as angry activists vented their displeasure on the innocent citizens of Abila after hearing the news of POK leader Elian Karel's death.  Karel, who had been awaiting trial for tax evasion, was found dead in his jail cell yesterday morning.  

The POK assembly began peacefully enough with the usual chanted slogans and waving of protest signs, but then one young rabble-rouser grabbed a bullhorn and began inciting the crowd to violence.  The crowd smashed windows and vandalized shops in the Siopa area, set fires in the streets, and clashed with police.  Additional police forces responded to contain the chaos and they were forced to use rubber bullets and tear gas in order to disperse the crowds.

President Kapelou's office released a statement about the rally, stating, "This sort of violence will not be condoned.  Destruction and violence is no way to achieve peace and change - these things are in opposition to each other.  The Protectors of Kronos must resume peaceful means; all other approaches are unjustifiable."</docText>

This article is the last installment of a series in three parts addressing the problem growing of an anguish of the community, the embezzlement of government, and influences it alarming at the multinational multinationals on the country of Kronos.

Pondo Reese, writer of the weekly newspaper of Elodis, is held with its window, looking at outside towards the sun placing on the river of Tiskele.  I asked him to say to me deeply about the participation of the government of Kronos in the alarming account of the fight of a community for protection against those which should help them more: their elected civils servant, counters those which would poison their children and the food of the country.

"It took in the long run so that no matter who answers," Reese says to me of their fight.  "Henk Bodrogi - the man whom you met - did not give up.  It called each department which could probably be associated our problem:  interior, justice, Affairs Foreign, health.    Henk and some other residents made several voyages in Abila trying to oblige somebody to listen.  In conclusion, a person laid out well of the ministry for health answered the door, as is where we started. "?

Reese then describes months of the meetings to which the civils servant of government required documents proving their case:  statistics of health and output of harvest, scientific test results of health for all, and medical discs.

"It had frustrated.  We bring the documents which they want, and then they want to confirm the results, or indicate to us to provide additional information or to have declared meetings closed of door.  We are currently in the course of negotiating a date for a hearing with the ministry for health to present our petition for the assistance."

Was it in value it?

"You say to me," of the signs of approval of Reese outside its window.  I look above his shoulder to see a group of children giving a kick a ball of football in dust.

KRONOS GOVERNMENT PLANS TAX BREAKS TO ENCOURAGE FOREIGN INVESTMENT

11 December 1992 

ABILA, Kronos - The Government of Kronos is currently planning some of the world's most generous tax breaks for gas investments. This will help create "cheap energy" that can give the developing country a competitive advantage and a leg up in the government's push to modernize.

As high-income countries from Europe and the United States race to take advantage of existing and potential gas deposits, Kronos is planning to provide incentives such as reducing corporate and individual tax, preferential tariffs, and derogations from regulations as well as cheap, but eager work force.

The Government of Kronos is pitching the plan as a win-win situation given that the high-income countries will be struggling to discover and exploit ever-dwindling supplies of fossil-fuels and the developing Kronos needs income, infrastructure, and cheap energy.

Look for energy companies to flock to Kronos.</docText>

&lt;&lt; to continue reading main history >>

They have damaged to the dozens of people in the perceived corruption excessive of the government of the protests and the perceived incapacity of politicians to improve the situation.

To clean to the bullets and the tear rubber gas used to calm malaise in the capital Abila. The black smoke could be to come sight from the compound of the presidency in Abila.

"To populate the protest because they are suffering, because they do not have medical aid. We demand the government we resigned," Terek Kamal, a driver of the car, said the times.

The malaise began in previous Abila in the week, with protests on the dismissal of several employees of Kronosian of international giant the GAStech energy.  GAStech has its roots in Tethys, although many directors live in Kronos.

This one appears to be a case of the frustration simmering that it boils above.

The administration is highly of support of GAStech and its rent of tax to the boxes of the government - it looks like yet not to pay attention of any edition pressing but to its own packages on-means of the payment.

The environmental situation is desperate. The hundreds of rural citizens are suffering the important diseases caused apparently by the exhibition to the useless currents of GAStech, although this one has not been verified civil employee nor recognizes by the company or the government. 

That is what sparked the initial protests in Abila - but empathy with its cause brought demonstrators towards outside in cities through Kronos.  Initially pacific, these protest are more and more violent now, and take to the police and to the citizens in sometimes fatal shooting.  

They quote president Dorel Kapelou II of Kronos then saying he would be summoning an urgent meeting of the superior direction to deal with the "threat the terrorist for La Paz" in the country.</docText>

Centrum's central role in the Tethan Gas Industry  

 

1982/10/03
 

The world of gas is distant, difficult and far flung. In Tethys a few years ago, I journeyed laboriously to the remote gas fields of Tethys to look at a contentious new energy producing area. 

One of the sites I visited was a local office of the Sanjorge Gas company, crammed with reinforced work boots and overalls and the chemicals and supplies you need to run a gas operation. 

But I'd forgotten about the encounter until I went back to Tethys the other day for the first time since their early years, to reacquaint with the man who created the business, Sten Sanjorge: one man (one of the richest individuals in Tethys) who has lived through the whole story of gas prospecting and prospered mightily from it. Something very significant has happened to turn Centrum into a global centre of gas industry expertise. The city has taken the temporary boon of energy on its doorstep, and turned it into specialized knowledge and intellectual property which may make Centrum a centre of gas expertise long after the gas itself runs out.</docText>

GAStech pump more than only gas. It has to cities and conducted for its verrichtingen cities to maintain, which it leads and almost single-handed in functioning put.

Of course, to people good reasons necessary in the hostile distant areas come and have worked Kronosian. They become to provide with medical care, recreation, and food.

The gas layers of curve of Tiskele thought more mainly than the first time



1996/03/14


ABILA, Kronos - a press release of the ministry for the interior announced today that the gas layers of curve of Tiskele could be less 5 times more mainly than in the beginning not estimated.  When we came into contact with the office of Sarto of minister for the comment says it "we were astonished by the results by the recent investigation by GAStech by the curve by Tiskele.  I want to say, this is simply enormous for the people of Kronos.  We already undertook several great projects of improvement like the left expansion and the new hospital which we could not differently have made because of the taxes that we see of our foreign investments.  This news ensures us almost will be able to collect these same dividends during decades to come!"



They go from oneself that the plan of the President Araullo' S to delude the foreign investment was one moment defining in our history.  It is hoped that those which had been so short-sighted as for oppose to its plan finally came to their directions.  We will say what they are too proud of saying: Thank you, Mr. chair.</docText>

POK LEADER KAREL ARRESTED 

 

2009/03/13
 

ABILA, Kronos ?????? In another unconscionable move against the citizens of Kronos, earlier today police arrested POK leader Elian Karel on spurious tax evasion charges. 

Demonstrating his trademark humor, Karel lifted his wrists and joked to his supporters as he is led away, ??????I guess I shouldn??????t have sent the President those cases of bottled water for his birthday.?????? 

Karel is the leader of the Protectors of Kronos, an alliance of Kronos citizens from Elodis that has demanded the government clean up the contaminated water caused by gas drilling in their community.  I ask:  Where is the money going??????? 

The police representative assured supporters who massed outside the police station that Karel would be treated humanely, but declined to answer questions or allow visitors to see Karel.</docText>

DRUG RELATED ARRESTS ON THE RISE
 
14 May 2011

ABILA, Kronos - An alarming new trend is sweeping Abila. Police point out a dramatic increase in drug related arrests that may be linked to violent activist groups. 

The port of Abila is known to be a transshipment point for drugs coming from the Middle East and Africa going to Europe namely heroin and hashish. However, drug related arrests had remained flat over the past decade until the recent increase. 

The concerns over the increase of drug related arrests are two-fold: first, violent activist groups such as the Protectors of Kronos could be using drug sales as a means to fund their activities; and second, with more drugs appearing on the shore, the people of Kronos will suffer increased drug related issues, namely addiction and violence.</docText>

Does WHO BRING a GUN TO ONE TO REST INSIDE?



2013/06/22


ABILA, Kronos - yesterday, because they more or less even have each June 19 during the three last years of defenders of the guards of Kronos gathered requiring as they have in fourteen last years:  an end with the corruption of the civils servant of government of Kronos and the cleaning of the toxic loss empty which became the river of Tiskele close to Elodis. 

The gathering which took place with several place of appointment through the city, including in front of the publically-had house of the President Kapelou' S and in front of the capital building of Abila.  The citizens collected to hope that their voices would be heard by their elected civils servant. They distribuer? information on insects printed and given by local companies about incongruities of life style between the civils servant elected of today and those few years ago. The demonstrators held of the posters of martyrdoms of POK and sang for the social and economic parity, whereas the black-plated members of the police force of Abila formed the lines without face of the shields, the sticks and the side arms surrounding crowd.

On each one the spirit was the question:  Who brings a gun to peaceful rests inside?  The gathering had been given publicity like peaceful meeting of the citizens to bring their concern to the public conscience.  The most dangerous article in their hands was an image of a dead old maid ten years nice - Juliana Vann which died in 1998 of the cancer caused by benzene in its drinking water.  

Why the government of Kronos did feel the need for sending the police force group of rough?

In spite of these awkward efforts, as the groups of people slipped by the barricades and moved by the streets to bring their message to the citizens of Kronos.  Insects bringing of the messages of the truth and justice were left on the park puts except play, in coffees and on the light posts.  

How can these civils servant - hypothetically obtaining near on public wages - allow the second homes, the large boats and the cars of luxury which they post?</docText>

For the moment at which Elian was 17 many of their members of the family and the friends fought constant disease, including their neighbor 10 years - old Julian Vann. "

Marek stopped briefly a little while to allow the shouts of "remembers Julian" to descolorar itself.

  Elian knew that his it would be a difficult trip.  He had watched his father, to Jeroen and founder of the POK, long walk of Henk Bodrogi the same trajectory that he would be above.  Elian knew that the course would not be easy, and that it would leave just a short time by a personal life.  He chose yet to take those measures in spite of the challenges that he knew that he would do in front. "

NO PROGRESS ON INVESTIGATION OF POK LEADER DEATH

12 August 2009 

ABILA, Kronos ? When the official coroner?s report was released last month about the death of POK leader Elian Karel there was no mention of the wounds observed on Karel?s body by eyewitnesses.  The official cause of death is sudden cardiac arrest.    It looks like the death of Karel will be swept under the same rug that hides the graft and corruption that has increasingly plagued our country for the last several years.</docText>

GASTECH HEADQUARTERS BLOCKED BY POK 

 

2009/02/19
 

ABILA, Kronos - A POK rally designed to bring attention to claims of environmental damage have done more damage to their image. The rally outside of GAStech International's headquarters resulted in multiple arrests for trespassing. 

 

About two hundred people gathered in front of the GAStech building chanting slogans and waving signs that held the visages of people who have allegedly died due to environmental contamination.  Ten of the protestors chained themselves to the doors of the building in an attempt to prevent GAStech employees from going to work. 

 

Police spokesman Adrien Carman said, "We allowed the group some latitude with their rally, but when GAStech complained that the protestors were blocking entrance to their building, we had to take action.  The last thing we wanted to happen was for a GAStech employee to get hurt by the crowd just because he was trying to go to work."</docText>

Shale gas pioneer plans world's first offshore wells in Mediterranean Sea  

 

1984/05/03
 

&lt;&lt;Deleted Image: Anti-offshore drilling protester.  Exploration has proved a controversial issue in Kronos>> 

Continue reading the main story  

The son of the founder of gas firm GAStech is planning a venture to drill in the Mediterranean Sea, the Times has learned. believes there are large volumes of offshore gas that could be extracted. 

"Certainly offshore gas isn't a new concept, but there's no reason with the Kronosian history of offshore development that we can't develop these resources offshore," he told the Times. 

Shale gas is extracted using the controversial technique of hyper-acidic substrate removal which involves injecting acidic chemicals shale layers, to break them up and release the natural gas trapped within. 

Hyper-acidic substrate removal has produced vast quantities of gas and oil in the West, transforming the energy market. 

Sanjorge says it will be a short time before we know if offshore shale gas can be exploited. 

Based on existing geological data, SanJorge believes that a considerable quantity of gas is in place - up to 100 trillion cubic feet, which would be more than GAStech's estimates for its onshore resources. 

GAStech has estimated that the Kronos total offshore shale gas resources could be between five and 10 times the size of the resources available onshore. 

Though it has only recently become controversial, hyper-acidic substrate removal has been used on a smaller scale for many years, to improve the flow from conventional oil and gas wells. But using the process on the large numbers of wells needed to extract offshore shale gas commercially has never been done. 

Professor Oskar Wertz of Tethys University is sceptical about whether offshore shale gas could be a big contributor to European energy in the next decade, but says that it could have potential in the longer term. 

"GAStech is being optimistic is its estimates of how long it will take to explore offshore shale. It's perfectly plausible that in 20, 30 or 40 years, the hyper-acidic substrate removal technology will have so advanced and the way in which we deal with the offshore environment will have so advanced that this could be a really big industry.</docText>

Sten Sanjorge, Jr. refused to directly present its observations on questions concerning of the protests and the contamination of the environment. It guided, "is today a splendid day for GAStech. I will not let the day be run off the line by nonfounded, limits libelous, allegations."</docText>

1732 UPDATE - Much of the information gathered from the GAStech employees who have been allowed to leave by police investigators point to a kidnapping of several GAStech employees. However, officials still have not confirmed a kidnapping has taken place. The number of missing employees is undetermined at this time given the earlier confusion with the false fire alarm.
There is some indication that the Protectors of Kronos - an activist group responsible for many recent demonstrations and riots in and around Abila - are suspected of being responsible for the kidnapping. If true, this is an alarming escalation of violence for the activist group.</docText>

ELIAN KAREL DEAD IN KRONOS JAIL 

 

2009/06/20
 

ABILA, Kronos -Elian Karel, age 28, died Friday while unlawfully incarcerated at the Abila City Prison.  Karel was being held on fraudulent tax evasion charges after his arrest on March 12 earlier this year.  What I can tell you is that when I left Elian yesterday after meeting with him in the prison he was in excellent health and good spirits.  He was expecting to be released in the next few days and return to his work with the Protectors of Kronos, and was excited to continue the Protectors of Kronos mission to which he dedicated his life.  I can assure you that Elian's death will be investigated with all the resources at our disposal and those responsible will be brought to justice." 

Karel, from Elodis, had been involved with the POK mission since he was young.  He was only a few years older than Juliana Vann, a friend who died in 1998 of toxin poisoning caused by illegal dumping from the Tethyn company GAStech.  

Calls to the President's office, the office of the Minister of Justice and the office of the Chief of Police were not immediately returned.</docText>

ABILA, Kronos - In a statement to the press today, government spokesman Rufus Drymiau said of the POK: "they are justifiably a public threat due to violent demonstrations, opportunistic vandalism, and clashes with the police."  Violence and vandalism have become a trademark of POK gatherings lately.

WHO ARE THE PROTESTERS 

22 August 2012 

ABILA, Kronos - With the third anniversary of Elian Karel's death approaching - former member of the Protectors of Kronos - the question is: who are the protesters? But not only who are they, what and why are they protesting? 

The Protectors of Kronos or POK were founded in 1997 by residents of rural Elodis on the advice of the now defunct Wellness for All (WFA), an international water safety group. The POK was initiated to bring attention to the clean water issues surrounding Elodis to the Government of Kronos and the world. The POK asserts that GAStech International's Tiskele Bend natural gas drilling site is the source of both the contamination of drinking water as well as the destruction of the traditional farmland surrounding Elodis. 

In 1998, WFA performed testing on the water of Elodis finding high levels of benzene, toluene and xylene arsenic, barium, chromium, lead and selenium. The testing a subsequent statement released by WFA brought international attention and pressure on the government and GAStech to act. However, with the fragmenting of WFA due to funding issues, the POK's demands were largely ignored and downplayed. 

Also in 1998, Juliana Vann, a previously healthy ten-year old girl died of a lingering illness, which WFA-funded doctors claimed was caused by water contamination. The Government of Kronos officially refuted the claim citing the fragmentation of the WFA organization as evidence of an unreliable source not to be trusted. Regardless, Juliana became the POK's first martyr and has used Juliana's image on campaign literature ever since. 

The POK's second major martyr is Elian Karel, who died in 2009 while incarcerated of undetermined causes. The POK asserts he was arrested on trumped up charges while the Government of Kronos contends he was a radical and violent activist engaged in tax evasion. Karel had been involved with the POK since its inception given that his father, Jeroen Karel, was an original member.  Elian Karel's death in 2009 was marked by spontaneous instances of protest around Abila. The anniversary of his death, June 19, has seen additional protests, demonstrations, riots, and violence. 

The POK has evolved from peaceful protests and demonstrations demanding government action to more violent activities including riots as they claim that the government has done little to nothing in addressing the contamination, poisonings, and deaths suffered by their people. As of 2011, the Government of Kronos has labeled the POK as a "public threat".</docText>

Annual ends of gathering of POK in the riot, still



2013/06/22


ABILA, Kronos - the members of POK held their annual demonstration in Abila yesterday.  A crowd larger than usual met in front of the building of capitol, undulating of the signs holding the images of Elian Karel and Juliana Vann, which were painted like POK "martyrdoms".  Crowd sang about the corruption of government and claimed President Dorel Kapelou to bring back.  Several protestateurs carried signs claiming an end "to the capitalism of exploitive corporation of Tethys" and pleading, "GAStech poisoned our children".  



The police force and the forces of safety of government established between the protestateurs and the building of capitol in an exposure of the force, hoping to prevent the kind of chaos which occurred during the riot of last year.  However, after several hours of the song and the speeches, hardenings in crowd widened and the protestateurs precipitated the line of police force.  The police force was forced to employ teargas, the pepper jet, the guns of water, and the rubber balls to subject crowd and to protect the property.  In spite of their heroic efforts, the protestateurs managed to break some windows, damage several vehicles of police force, and wound three leaders.</docText>

The insight of an expert: thriving as foreign CEO in Kronos 

2014/03/26
17 January 1995



The strict Fluss are CEO of GAStech, the important industry of Krono more than 15 years, after its discovery of its immense gasvelden near the city of Elodis.

Fluss, have worked with dozens of foreign CEOs in the course of the years. However, he has records beginning as oil and gasprospector in Tethys. 

He spoke to The Times concerning the appetites of a successful LEADER in Kronos and which foreign CEOs in the market can expect. 

Q: What is possible foreign CEOs when they to Kronos expects come?

A: The economic environment has changed for the eighties. It is succeed much today more with difficulty. Foreign need CEOs their minimize expectations. There are easily none wins in Kronos. The competition under Kronosian and foreign firma's is tough. It is difficult the harten and win the opinions of the population.

But there is less difference than people between culture Kronosian think and, culture says Tethian. The staff work of Kronos like only hard, is they respectful of their work and has same the wish for success. They know also it how at to appreciate efficient communication and a gifted LEADER.

What a foreign LEADER must do is learns how at to communicate Kronosian to the manner and time to demand to understand their staff.

Q: Can you develop?

A: There are a lot of cultural differences in communicating. [Think] after memoranda. Foreign CEOs have been always confused and frustrated when they send a memorandum [to someone in Kronos] and simple ja/nee expect answer. In place of it they become a very long answer to that their initial question does not answer.

People of Kronos love the no responsibility to take. They are do be scared to lose their job and do not love in saying something are forced they to wants. Foreign need CEOs this take into account and the time to have demand to understand how at to communicate.

Patience is very important. Transparency can be an excellent get manner around this. It is a European value that Kronosians to very receptive is. Imposing in a company can turn foreign CEO into the travel in Kronos a more pleasant experience.

Q: What are the most important challenges foreign CEO can on arrival in Kronos under eyes see?



A: Sometimes it is the simple things that can be the challenge, such as getting A to B in a taxi. Are able round to be easily taken for granted and cannot do cre?rt this a large meaning of uncertainty. In Kronos are you never certainly as your driver you on the planned address sale. This is possible if a small question seems but on a daily basis it is very tiring.

Another get to know your team and which you work with. Frequently foreign CEOs staprecht of the plane and in an office peak of employees Kronos. They have no idea that they are, how they work or how qualified they are. This can be confusing. 

The need of CEOs demand the time to speak for their staff, of the administrators for the truck drivers and their new environment to understand before they try and them lead.

Q: Can you give a couple ends on how foreign CEO can preparations make?

A: The first thing which I am your prepare family would say. They can find it difficult to adapt to the new work surroundings. This can influence it personal life. Mixing family and the work is here very common practice. People of Kronos work overtime and socialiseren with their colleagues it is very differing from Tethys where there is a clear border between the work and family.

Foreign CEOs also must realize how tough are the competition and how much hard work must be introduced to succeed -- frequently much more than in their birth country. The language is a large question.

[But] no question how much you prepare, real experience will surprise in Kronos to work and live you always.

Q: How difficult - or easy - is it for foreign CEO in Kronos to be?

A: Generally, think I am CEO hard am. There is a lot very, is the environment tough and it is difficult find a balance with your personal life.

When a team hears Kronos that CEO come assume from overseas she is it a problem. But culturally they have no question with aliens. 

Q: There are situations in which it are a foreign staff employee in fact an advantage is?

A: This question depends really on the person and how much they invest to understand the country and culture. If they make no effort then to localize is it a net disadvantage. But in certain negotiations or certain questions such as luxegoederen, foreign CEOs can be an advantage. They can bring to a another view, the process to facilitate.

Sometimes foreign CEO better knowledge of the industry have and can access to markets overseas bring. This can be real assets.</docText>

ELODIS, KRONOS:  A CITY IN the NEED, part one



1998/03/20


This article is the first installment of a series in three parts addressing the problem growing of an anguish of the community, the embezzlement of government, and influences it alarming at the multinational multinationals on the country of Kronos.

ELODIS, Kronos - nested in the curve of the river of Tiskele, the sun rises surplus the cultivatrice city of Elodis, driving out far the shades masking the millitorr close Bouro.  Today, because they have daily during more than 250 years, the residents will rise to tighten the rich ground of floodplain which provides the food for the people of Kronos.

Two weeks before I received an email of an old friend, Pondo Reese, maintaining the writer of the weekly newspaper of Elodis, a paper of agriculture serving the community around the curve of Tiskele. In its email it described once beneficial area now afflicted by the contamination, fighting to find solutions with a problem of deterioration.  I decided to study.

"We did not draw up the report/ratio at the beginning," Reese said to me when I met him at his office.  "The gas company had been back of a few years established in '94, and our problems did not start immediately.   After a couple of the harvests, we saw a decline in the production.   We thought that perhaps it was right a hoquet, and the things would be better.  Then when to fall started with problem childs threw us a harder glance with what could have changed. "?

The change proved to be international GAStech, an international company directed by Sten Sanjorge Jr, a big businessman of businesses out of Tethys.

Bench in 1961, the company of GAStech started like businesses had by family providing of the local services of haulage in Tethys.  The two founders - Sr and hank Fluss de Sten Sanjorge - wild drilling found with being more lucrative, and thus began a series of environmental disasters and scandals financial which ran thereafter Sr of Sanjorge in a tomb early and led Fluss in a marginal role to its own company.  With the death of Sr of Sanjorge, the son took the bar of GAStech firmly in his catch and widened his influence further with far, thereafter unloading with the threshold of the small peaceful black suburbs of Elodis.

With a population of 6500, the majority of the residents of Elodis live in houses one and of two-history to small farms.  A smaller number of families live in the black suburbs along a principal street with two markets, two stores of material, a gas station and a coffee where you can buy the lunch, take your mail and buy one liter of milk to bring the house.  The families lived in Elodis for generations.

"We made for a long time a good life," Reese says to me. "The population had firmly increased.  The vegetable production was good.  For the majority, the children did not leave for the city as they have in many of other rural places.  We have much ground which could still be developed. There was a future for them here."

I asked Reese to help me to meet the people whose lives were carried out by the operations of GAStech' S. It presented to me at a farmer whose family had been here for several generations.  

I caught up with myself compared to Henk Bodrogi downtown making of the purchases to the store of material of Osvaldo to repair a broken tractor.  Bodrogi cultivated soya its life whole, just as his/her father and their fathers. I questioned it about his life with the farm.

The hospitals which see Toevloed of the users of the drug of the designer of Abila



2013/02/08
The department of the emergency situation at the general hospital Abila in Kronos has been under water put in previous month by people who suffer from medical complications from designer drugs such as cotton suikergoed and the synthetic marihuana, a hospital civil servant said.

We have fallen at least two dozens in previous month, aforesaid Alicia Bianca, nurse manager of the department have. We are litterally overwhelmed.

Bianca this level never said they have seen of activity concerning drug overdoses in the seven years they the department have conducted of the emergency situation and in the 20 years they a nurse has been.

The authorities in Abila said cotton the suikergoed a factor in the death of 54 one people whose birthday it is Ralf for the can be, it of which gekneuste and naked body 4 February along coming to an end gone were found. The research workers wait the toxicologies for reports stipulate the cause of death are. Attributed in very the city, its different sterfgevallen to cotton Suikergoed according to the national center of the Vergift Kronos.

The patients end up to Abila commonly by the larger town area, and they include adults and young people, male and female, and all socioe-economic contexts, aforesaid Bianca.

Sgt Antonio Arresta of the section of the fire Abila, eerste-antwoordapparaat a question in the city, medical to emergency situation, said its department also an ear in the number of people has seen that treatment for complications of designer drugs has. We went of zero question to hand-full question in previous month, he said.

Bianca and Arresta said their efforts treat people are provided more with difficulty because they do not know frequently no matter what concerning the designer drugs that were taken.

YOU weet what you when you get it, do not get aforesaid Bianca. We have patients come in have and uncontrolled act, who are very violent. They tell our they cotton suikergoed have done or synthetic marihuana.

There aforesaid Bianca little has been clinically obeyed concerning of cotton suikergoed, since it is a new toxic substance. There are no checked studies in toxicology, she said. The national vergiftcentrum collect anecdotische reports concerning overdoses of the hospitals and other suppliers as part of efforts to offer Council on how at to treat patients.

The drugs of the designer are chemical compositions which are composed to seem on the active ingredient in frequently illegitimate drugs. Cotton the suikergoed bootst the drug after khat, a stimulant. The manufacturers frequently change the chemical composition of the designer drug and are name one step for authorities remain, aforesaid Biance. It is another manner sell it, she said.

Term cotton suikergoed, for example, is a nickname of the drug and has to do nothing with carnival treats. The drug has been sold under the name of the dreams of the Kruid one yielded and under the name of the Bloesem of the Tulp next. 

The government has placed Kronos three of the commonly use chemical products in the realization of cotton suikergoed on its checked substance list and labelling as a crime their use and has. Still, the government cannot prohibit cotton suikergoed entirely because the manufacturers can the recipe change and the law, aforesaid Bianca to limit. The drugs are sold online as therapytherapy therapy products and are available concerning the meter in area rise.

We know still what with cotton suikergoed does not get you. The chemical composition vari?rt of parcel to parcel, aforesaid Bianca.

One factor for the popularity of cotton suikergoed is low costs, aforesaid Bianca be. She said a gram cotton sugar well costs concerning K18 whereas a gram cocaine costs K166.

An altitude to euphoria, or, which right is or larger than that of, leads cotton the suikergoed cocaine but also a discharge causes which is worse, aforesaid Bianca. The disadvantageous impact of discharge causes frequently people to binge on cotton suikergoed to the point where they consume the drug for days. They hanker to, she said.

After repeated use, the drug Courts roasted the brain of a person, who the chemical products descend those are verrichtingen in balance bring. This leads sometimes to bizar, frequently psychotic behavior that in the media, such as the case of the naked man in Elodis who was found it in the middle of of important gone has been reducing communicated, aforesaid Bianca. The beslagleggingen and the imagining ideas are incredibly, she said.

Whereas it is not yet stipulated who is behind the distribution of this round of designer drugs, the police force pursues verdachte organized crime this large income source. The army of people is Asterian traditional ge?mpliceerdd with drug trafficking by the area, and the maintaining agencies researches near possible cooperation between drug trafficking organizations and political rebellious groups.</docText>

SANJORGE JR CONDEMN POK AS TERRORISTS



2009/02/22


CENTER, Tethys - an official declaration which by Sten Sanjorge, the international President of Jr. and CEO of GASTech are released, condemn the guards of Kronos as both illegitimate and terrorists organization. The declaration passed GAStech in reply to the protest collection of Wednesday POK at the hoofdkwartier - Kronos.



Roughly speaking 200 people who for the GAStech construction chanting slogans is collected and undulating sign claiming people been appropriate the results of pollution of GAStech boringsplaats have died. Sanjorge, Jr. answered saying to GAStech to the requirements of pollution, we [GAStech] tirelessly have worked meet - as do not exceed - the international gezondheidsnormen which on with the government of Kronos before no matter which and even if drilling is approved.



Ten protesters POK chained themselves to the door of barring entrance GAStech - Kronos to the bldg. 



In a long declaration Sanjorge Jr. its argument makes up, if a person is prepared on private possession, violate if a person is prepared to a door to chain to prevent if matter, a person is prepared to break windows and cars in its own city to burn, then has been prepared in functioning that person to put do no matter what. And if a person is prepared no matter what to do their eventual aim realize then to beat they apprehension in the common citizen. I fear what they will do afterwards because I fear what they arranged for to be.

Continue reading the main story	
The government of Kronos has declared the Protectors of Kronos a terrorist group after blaming it for a deadly attack on police headquarters earlier this week.
Several of its supporters have been arrested in a crackdown.
A POK leader vowed that protests would continue.
Government spokesman Rufus Drymiau announced the move, which will give the authorities more power to crack down on the POK.
He said that those who belonged to the group, financed it or promoted its activities would face punishment.

The Protectors of Kronos
    Kronos's oldest and largest environmental activist organization
    Founded in 1997.
    Influenced by international groups such as Wellness for All
    Mixes political activism with environmental work
    Rejects use of violence and supports democratic principles
    Slogan: "Justice for Juliana", a reference to a 10-year old Kronosian girl who died as a result of government sponsored environmental contamination 

    

The decision was in response to Tuesday's bombing of a police headquarters in Abila, he said.
"Kronos was horrified from north to south by the hideous crime committed by the POK," Mr. Drymiau said.
"This was in context of dangerous escalation to violence against Kronos and Kronosians and a clear declaration by the POK that it knows nothing but violence.
"It's not possible for Kronos the state nor Kronos the people to submit to the POK terrorism."
Kronos would notify Tethys who had signed a 1998 anti-terrorism treaty of the decision, he added.
POK supporters
The POK has denied being responsible for the attack, and accused the Kronos government of staging a frame-up to silence the groups concerns for the people.
A POK member told the Times that the government's decision was "illegitimate".
He added: "The protests will continue, certainly."</docText>

"We are not requesting any desrazonable thing," Karel speaks enthusiastic to its ardent listeners.  "The only thing that we wished is to know are being used our taxes.  We know that these corporations are generating benefits of the files to expenses of Kronos, but do not see no of the engaged improvements.  The only thing that we wished is responsibility for that they died due to avarice, the corruption and the indifference of a that must protect."

ABILA, Kronos - a launching of press of the Department of the Interior announced today that the gas fields of the curve of Tiskele could as much be as considered 5 times more to a great extent than originally.  When we made contact with enemy with the office of Sarto of the minister for the commentary, he said, "we were astonished by the results of the survey on recent GAStech of the curve of Tiskele.  I mean, this I am hardly enormous for the people of Kronos.  We have already undertaken several great projects of the improvement like the harbor extension and the new hospital that we could not of another way to do due to the taxes that we are seeing of our foreign investments.  These news almost assure to us will be able to harvest those same dividends per decades to come"

The POK members hit him with a bottle, which knocked him to the ground and gave him a bloody gash on his forehead.  Abila police attempted to gain control of the situation by using bullhorns to call for the peaceful dispersal of the crowd, but the crowd responded to their calls by hurling insults along with a few rocks at the officers.  Police used tear gas to end the gathering, but a handful of die-hard POK members urged the crowd into melee with the officers.  Additional security forces had to be summoned to help contain the situation as the violence escalated.  When the tear gas finally cleared, six POK member were arrested on charges of assault on civil authorities and inciting a crowd to violence.  Three police officers were treated at Abila General Hospital for wounds received in the fight.

"We had been concerned that Silvia Marek's weak leadership is allowing the POK to be taken over by criminals and hooligans.  Today's events show that our concerns were valid," said police spokesman Adrien Carman.  Marek replaced Elian Karel as the popular figurehead of the POK movement last summer.</docText>

Kronos protests break out in violence 

12 November 2013

Journalist Shawn Pastorini says "lack of respect" is fuelling the protests
&lt;&lt; Continue reading the main story >>	
Demonstrators in Abilia, Kronos have set fire to government buildings, in another round of unrest in this torn city
Dozens of people have been injured in protests over perceived government corruption and perceived inability of politicians to improve the situation.
Police used rubber bullets and tear gas to quell unrest in the capital Abila . Black smoke could be seen coming from the presidency compound in Abila.
&lt;&lt; Continue reading the main story >>	
A Protectors of Kronos spokesperson stated "In Kronos the legacies of the environmental neglect and lack of concern for the people mean that few even hope for change anymore. For this reason, anger has been simmering for years, but now it has boiled over"
Police used water to disperse the protesters who were throwing stones at the building. There were also reports of an attempted storming of the office.
"People protest because they are suffering, because they don't have medical help. We demand the government resign," Terek Kamal, a truck driver, told the Times.
The unrest began in Abila earlier in the week, with protests over the dismissal of several Kronosian employees from energy giant GAStech International.  GAStech has its roots in Tethys, although many directors live in Kronos.
This appears to be a case of simmering frustration boiling over.
The administration is highly supportive of GAStech and its tax income to the government coffers - yet seems to ignore any pressing issues but its own above-average pay packets.
The environmental  situation is desperate. Hundreds of rural citizens are suffering major illnesses apparently caused by exposure to GAStech waste streams, although this has not been official substantiated or acknowledge by either the company or government. 
That is what sparked the initial protests in Abila - but empathy with their cause brought demonstrators out in towns across Kronos.  Initially peaceful, these protest are now increasingly violent, and both police and citizens are caught in sometime fatal crossfire.  
Kronos President  Dorel Kapelou II is quoted as saying he would be calling an urgent meeting of the top leadership to address the "terrorist threat to peace" in the country.</docText>

ELODIS, KRONOS:  HELP FROM AN UNEXPECTED SOURCE Part Two
Petrus Gerhard
25 April 1998

This article is the second installment of a three-part series addressing the growing problem of one community's anguish, government malfeasance, and the alarming influence of multinational corporations on the country of Kronos.
I caught up with Henk Bodrogi in town making purchases at Ferro Hardware store to repair a broken tractor.  Bodrogi has farmed soybeans his entire life, as did his father and their fathers. I asked him about his life on the farm.
 "We've worked the land for a long time - maybe 200 years, maybe a bit more," Henk Bodrogi told me as he picked over a container of bolts, searching for the right size.  "Over the years we've added a few hectares here and there.  It keeps us busy."
Busy is an understatement, as I found when I prodded the wiry farmer to tell me more.
"I usually head to the fields before sun up," Mr. Henk Bodrogi tells me. "My wife gets the kids up and heading to school, then she'll make a little something for us to eat for lunch and work alongside me until dinner.  When the children get home from school they do their chores, and we're all back at the house most times by dark."
"We do this most days," he adds, "except for worship days."
Bodrogi identifies the appropriate bolt and chats with the cashier about kids and school as he completes his purchase.
"We all know one another here," Bodrogi explains as we leave. "Most families have lived here for generations.  The first new people that came to town were with that gas company that built a few years back."
I ask Bodrogi if business has been good. 
"We were doing pretty good until recently.  Profits were good and we add acreage, or upgrade equipment.  Then we started having all this trouble with the crops."
In what way, I asked.
"The crops aren't producing like they have in the past.  It took a while to figure out, then one of the city officers figured out to call in a water specialist.  When they tested it they said the water was contaminated."
Bodrodgi sighed, and with a beleaguered look in his eye he thanked me for my interest and told me he had to head back home.  The tractor had to be fixed before they could work the next day.  I thanked him and watched him climb into his truck and head out of town.
The water specialist turned out to be the international agency "Wellness For All", an international agency with a mission to bring healthy water to communities distressed by natural disasters, draught and - coincidentally - oil and gas development.
I caught up with a representative from Wellness for All the next day.  Joclyn Reynolds is project coordinator for "Wellness for All".  She spoke to me over a satellite call from her field office in Southeast Asia where she was setting up relief efforts following an earthquake. Ms. Reynolds agreed to speak to me for a few minutes between meetings about their work in Elodis.
"We were contacted by a city official about a problem they were having with their local water.  In the last few years agriculture had foundered, and the incidence of certain illnesses and birth defects had risen.  The Elodis drinking water comes from the Tiskele River, as does all the water for farming, so we looked for a source upstream.  We found sources of production waste disposal at the GAStech operation upstream.  Tests showed high levels of benzene, toluene, xylene arsenic, lead and selenium, among other toxins. "
"Can these substances occur naturally?" I asked her.
"Not in these amounts, and not this suddenly.  Groundwater contamination is usually the result of human activity.  The GAStech pipes are releasing contaminants into a pond.  The toxins are forming a subsurface plume that seeps into the Tiskele River from which the residents of Elodis draw their drinking water and irrigation for the crops."
"Did you talk to GAStech about this?"
"Oh yes," she replied.  "At first we believed we were gaining traction.  We met several times with GAStech representatives, including one of the senior executives, Hank Fluss.  He personally assured us GAStech would act responsibly to provide material and financial assistance toward cleanup efforts.  After a time, though, it became clear that while Mr. Fluss was earnest it was Sanjorge who makes the decisions.  It is apparent that he [Sanjorge] has no interest in the wellbeing of the residents of Elodis, or the environment."
Sten Sanjorge, Jr., who had inherited his share in the company from his father in 1990, had developed a reputation for cutthroat business practices.
"When we didn't make headway with GAStech," Reynolds continued, "the community leaders decided to approach the government of Kronos for assistance.   Per our policy -and with permission from the Elodis leaders - we published the test results in an official public document.  The Elodis leaders then approached the government officials as citizens of a Kronesian community armed with the scientific analysis.  Our agency assured them we would again be available to help in any way when those agreements were finalized."
At this point Ms Reynolds was called away from the phone, so I returned to my editor friend, Pondo Reese to tell finish the story.

The central role of the centrum in the gas industry of Tethan 



1982/10/04


The world of gas is distant, difficult and vast. In Tethys a few years ago, I travelled laboriously to the remote gas layers of Tethys to look at a new controversial sector of energy production.

One of the sites which I visited was a local office of the gas company of Sanjorge, lined initializations of work and reinforced combinations and the chemicals and the provisioning you must run a gas operation. As I remember it, a former truck-driver was responsible.

It was a sharp example in the way in which a company of exploration once small of Thethys had started to develop in a powerful international force in the industry of energy.

But I had forgotten the meeting until I would have gone again in Tethys the other day for the first time since their first years, with the reacquaint with the man who created the businesses, Sten Sanjorge: a man (one of the richest individuals in Tethys) which lived by the whole history of prospecting gas and thrived strongly of him.

But while I went around the capital city of the interviewing people of centrum, I realized soon that it was not simply a history of new energy. Something very significant A precisely proves to transform the centrum into total center of expertise of gas industry. Of what is developed in the capital city there are important lessons for other places blessed (and cursed) with the abundant natural resources.

The "centrum developed the expertise of class of the world while machinant in very difficult environments"

When I was a young journalist on the daily disc in Glasgow at the beginning of the Seventies, great oil precipitations at sea began North at sea. It then seemed a pretty impossible dream, transforming a coal island into place with the abundant gas and oil provisioning.

It seemed with us on the Western coast of Scotland that the vast city of the centrum, Tethys obtained with a little large for its initializations, starting to believe in new industry of imagination.

Much with the regrets of his/her mother, while waiting, Sten Sanjorge had begun the prospection at the beginning of the Sixties.

With the beginning of the Seventies, a new company of gas, GAStech, began the sound truck-like advances.

Under its careful councils, GAStech was transformed into an important supplier of natural gas to the local area, and then much further with far. It now has employees of thousands and functions in many countries. 

The change of the centrum was substantial.  You note them in the constant basic image of the helicopters to-ing and of fro-ing outside to the areas moved away, and had aligned them with the airport of the city to make the shuttle of the execs in the two directions of the city.

And while you lead around the centrum, almost each round not is financed by a division of GAStech. 

Sanjorge recently started to pay more attention to the activities of leisures and philanthropy, allowing its Jr. and hank Fluss de wire Sten of cofounder to direct the company. But Sanjorge was right guest to produce a report/ratio for the government of Tethan recommending the best manners of securing than Tethys continuous to produce energy during decades to come.

The substance easy-with-to obtain was produced, thus to keep to come from gas will need many investment and new more intelligent techniques, such as the techniques hyperacides of displacement of substrate developed by the company in 1974. 

Thus mercies with the intelligent people such as Sten Sanjorge and the people who work with him, centrum carried out what each place where raw materials are discovered wishes ardently to do. The city took the provisional advantage of energy on its threshold, and transformed into specialized knowledge and intellectual property which can return centrum a center of the long gas expertise after the gas itself becomes exhausted.</docText>

GASTECH EMPLOYEE INTERROGATED, RELEASED

20 January 2014

ABILA, Kronos - For roughly 6 hours GAStech - Kronos employee Edvard Vann was interrogated by Kronos Police and Government officials before being released at 17:00 this evening. The apparent confusion stems from the similarity between his name and that of a Protector of Kronos member.

Vann, a security guard for GAStech, was furious, stating, "I have nothing to do whatsoever with any members of the terrorist group POK. I know no one from Elodis. I was born here in Abila and I support my government and my president. Being accused and being interrogated for 6 hours as a terrorist POK member is one of the worst days of my life. Just because a person has the same name as a criminal does not make him a criminal."

Though he was instructed not to communicate with the press Vann was adamant to stress his innocence. With some 14 GAStech employees still unaccounted for, one cannot blame the police or the government for not leaving any stone unturned.</docText>

ABILA, Kronos - In a statement to the press today, government spokesman Rufus Drymiau said of the POK: "they are justifiably a public threat due to violent demonstrations, opportunistic vandalism, and clashes with the police."  Violence and vandalism have become a trademark of POK gatherings lately.

EXPLOSION ROCKS GASTECH'S TISKELE BEND SITE

15 August 2000

ABILA, Kronos - An explosion at a nearby gas drilling well pad woke Rebecca Cato around 3 a.m. on Sunday morning. When she left her home in Elodis, Kronos - a rural township outside the capital Abila - to investigate the noise she noticed a large fire coming from GAStech International's Tiskele Bend site.

The GAStech-owned well near Elodis ignited methane gas underground causing a fire that lasted for around an hour. At least four GAStech employees appeared to have been taken away by ambulance; however, GAStech has declined to comment on the extent and nature of their injuries. 

GAStech's CEO Sten Sanjorge Jr. downplayed the event stating, "This event could hardly be described as an explosion," but merely a common practice referred to as flaring. He continued, "I won't bore you with the details, but a temporary flare is often used during well production testing." 

Mrs. Cato and other locals from Elodis were turned away by GAStech employees and government officials. Eventually, locals downriver were evacuated. Rebecca Cato said, "After sending us away without a single question answered, they came to our doors and told us to leave our homes. It was the middle of the night where was I to go."</docText>

GRAND OPENING GASTECH-KRONOS

10 October 1995

ABILA, Kronos - With his trademark flash, Sten Sanjorge, Jr. President of GAStech International opened the new GAStech-Kronos headquarters. The ribbon was cut with a huge pair of scissors, matched in size only by Sanjorge Jr.'s smile. 

The 50 million dollar price tag for the new headquarters is just a drop in the bucket for GAStech. The gas field in production outside of Abila has exceeded even Sanjorge's oversized expectations, paying for the building many times over. 

Present at the ribbon cutting ceremony were several representatives from the Kronos Government.</docText>

The pioneer of the gas of the slate plans first wells outside coast of the world in the Mediterranean Sea 



1984/05/05


&lt;&lt;Deleted image: Demonstrator whom it perforates of Anti-offshore.  The exploration has proven an controversial edition in Kronos>>

To continue reading main history	

The son of the founder of the company/signature of the gas that GAStech is planning a company to perforate inside the Mediterranean Sea, the times has learned.

Sten Sanjorge, Jr thinks that there are the great volumes of gas coast outside that could be extracted.

Sanjorge and GAStech were granted to three licenses by the government of Kronos the month last through the ministry of the energy and the development and hopes to begin the exploration soon.

"The gas certainly coast outside is not a new concept, but there is no reason with the history of Kronosian of the development coast outside that we cannot develop to these resources coast outside," he said the times.

The gas of the slate is extracted using the controversial technique of the hyperacid retirement of the substratum that implies injecting of acid layers of the slate of chemical agents, to break them for above and sending the catched natural gas inside.

The hyperacid retirement of the substratum has produced the extensive amounts of gas and oil in the one of the west, having transformed the market of the energy. But the projects in Europe have been slow to remove, surrounded with the opposition of the government and local communities.



Many ecologists think that the hyperacid retirement of the substratum can damage marine atmospheres, and oppose the extraction of the new resources of the fossil fuel. But perforating coast outside avoids the necessity of the difficult negotiations with the local advice, communities and landholders.

In agreement with existing geologic data, SanJorge thinks that a considerable amount of gas is in the place - up to 100 cubical feet trill?n, that would be more than the estimations of GAStech for their terrestrial resources. There is also the possibility of finding the oil.

GAStech has considered that the resources coast outside of the gas of the slate of the total of Kronos could be between five and 10 times the terrestrial size of the available one of the resources.



"We are that the resource is there and the numbers are absolutely ginormous," said very comfortable SanJorge.  "Is anyone of that one explotable? That one is billion questions of the dollar, and GAStech wiling to invest in the answer."

Although it has gotten to be only recently controversial, the hyperacid retirement of the substratum has been used in one more a smaller scale by many years, to improve the gas and conventional well flow of the oil. But to use the process in a great amount of needed wells to extract the gas coast outside of the slate never has been made commercially.

Professor Oskar Wertz of the university of Tethys is skeptical around if the gas coast outside of the slate could be a great contribuidor to the European energy in the next decade, but says that he could have potential in the one of more long term.

"GAStech is being optimistic is its estimations of how long will take to explore the slate outside coast. He is perfectly reasonable that in 20, 30 or 40 years, the hyperacid technology of the retirement of the substratum will have so advanced and the way of which we took care outside of the ambient coast we will have so advanced that this could be a really great industry. The task in the 10 next years is to try these things towards outside, considers if they work."</docText>

KIDNAPPING AT GASTECH KRONOS 

20 January 2014

ABILA, Kronos - After a long day of conflicting and confusing information reports are still sketchy, but the story is beginning to come clear: a Kronos Government source has confirmed up to fourteen of GAStech International's employees may have been kidnapped at the company's headquarters in Abila. 

Much speculation remains regarding who was taken in the kidnapping. Speculation includes whether or not GAStech International President and CEO Sten Sanjorge Jr. was the target given that GAStech International has yet to make a statement to the press. Speculation about the motivation behind the kidnapping has also been rampant due to the recent GAStech IPO.

At this time no one has claimed responsibility for the kidnapping. Edvard Vann, a GAStech - Kronos security guard who was interrogated and released after 6 hours, indicated the Protectors of Kronos were suspected as being the perpetrators behind today's events.

A GAStech International senior security executive has been on site to support the investigation, aiding the Abila Police Department and Kronos Government officials.

January 20th was GAStech's annual corporate meeting. At some point while company officers were transitioning from the main office to a Kronos Government reception the abductions took place. 

Unconfirmed reports of a fire at the office may have served as a distraction for the kidnappers or at least contributed to the confusion during the event. Abila Fire Department trucks were dispatched to GAStech - Kronos headquarters around 10:00 this morning local Kronos time to respond to a fire alarm.</docText>

GOVERNMENT RESPONDS TO ANOTHER ROUND OF PROTESTS 

20 June 2010 

ABILA, Kronos - Protesters aligned with the Protectors of Kronos (POK) activist group surrounded government buildings chanting and carry images of their so-called martyrs. Kronos government security forces in concert with Abila police suppressed the protest with an impressive show of force.

Dressed in black the authorities donning helmets and gasmasks and brandishing riot shields, fired tear gas canisters as the protesters refused to disperse after several warnings. The group gathered proved reluctant to disperse even after the tear gas and the authorities pressed into the group protecting themselves with their shields and freely swinging their batons.

In the face of overwhelming force, most of the protesters fled; however, a hard core group stood their ground suffering the consequences. The remaining protesters were surrounded by the riot police and after repeated baton blows many were dragged away under arrest. 

When the smoke cleared amongst the discarded and trampled banners and signs, blood was clearly visible on the plaza.</docText>

KRONOS GOVERNMENT PLANS TAX BREAKS TO ENCOURAGE FOREIGN INVESTMENT 

 

1992/12/12
 

ABILA, Kronos - The Government of Kronos is currently planning some of the world's most generous tax breaks for gas investments. 

 

As high-income countries from Europe and the United States race to take advantage of existing and potential gas deposits, Kronos is planning to provide incentives such as reducing corporate and individual tax, preferential tariffs, and derogations from regulations as well as cheap, but eager work force. 

 

The Government of Kronos is pitching the plan as a win-win situation given that the high-income countries will be struggling to discover and exploit ever-dwindling supplies of fossil-fuels and the developing Kronos needs income, infrastructure, and cheap energy.</docText>

GASTECH SHIFTS FOCUS TO KRONOS

7 July 1996

CENTRUM, Tethys - GAStech International has shifted its focus from Tethys to the small Mediterranean island of Kronos and the vast gas deposits beneath the ground.

Recent charges of groundwater contamination against GAStech International and tightening environmental regulations lead by the Tethan Interior Minister, Ivar Blanes, certainly play into the shifting focus. 

With environmental regulation lax to nonexistent in Kronos and a friendly local government, GAStech's move feels inevitable in hindsight.</docText>

KIDNAPPING AT GASTECH KRONOS  

 

2014/01/20
 

ABILA, Kronos - After a long day of conflicting and confusing information reports are still sketchy, but the story is beginning to come clear: a Kronos Government source has confirmed up to fourteen of GAStech International's employees may have been kidnapped at the company's headquarters in Abila. Speculation includes whether or not GAStech International President and CEO Sten Sanjorge Jr. was the target given that GAStech International has yet to make a statement to the press. Speculation about the motivation behind the kidnapping has also been rampant due to the recent GAStech IPO. Edvard Vann, a GAStech - Kronos security guard who was interrogated and released after 6 hours, indicated the Protectors of Kronos were suspected as being the perpetrators behind today's events. 

 

A GAStech International senior security executive has been on site to support the investigation, aiding the Abila Police Department and Kronos Government officials. At some point while company officers were transitioning from the main office to a Kronos Government reception the abductions took place. Abila Fire Department trucks were dispatched to GAStech - Kronos headquarters around 10:00 this morning local Kronos time to respond to a fire alarm.</docText>

CHIEF KAREL OF STOPPED POK



2009/03/14


ABILA, Kronos - in another unjust movement against the citizens of Kronos, a police force earlier of today stopped the Chief of POK Elian Karel on incidental expense of tax avoidance.  It was carried out - manacled - starting from a meeting of the guards of Kronos in Elodis, rural black suburbs external Abila.

Showing its mood of trade mark, Karel raised its wrists and joked with its defenders as it is carried out far, "I guess that I should not have sent to the president these cases water bottled for his birthday."

Karel is the chief of the guards of Kronos, an alliance of the citizens of Kronos d' Elodis which required the clean top of government the soiled water caused by gas drilling in their community.

"We did not ask GAStech to come to our community," spoke of Karel to a gathering a few months ago.  "Nous' did not ask our water to become undrinkable, so that our children become sick.  Neither Elodis nor the people of Kronos received any advantage of the amount of money extraordinarily large only GAStech releases each year.  I ask:  Where is the active money?"

The assured defenders representative of police force who piled up apart from the police station that Karel would be treated with humanity, but refused to answer questions or to allow visitors to see Karel.

"He is a determined man," the agent of Karel that Michale Kraft indicated to me above the telephone. "It will fight these false expenses and will be outside in a few days.  He will probably complain about food about prison to the next gathering about POK." 

Kraft projects to meet the morning of Karel Saturday.

Calls with the president and the Minister for the offices of justice were not immediately turned over.</docText>

1330 UPDATE - At 1315 we placed a call to GAStech headquarters. A hesitant administrative assistant to Orhan Strum, Chief Operating Officer of GAStech claimed Mr. Strum was unavailable. Linda Lagos the assistant to Mr. Strum declined to answer any further questions about the incident, whether or not there was a fire, a false alarm, a bomb threat, or whether or not anyone is missing.
Uneasy throughout the call, Ms. Lagos repeated that Orhan Strum was unavailable at this time, said good bye and hung up. Additional calls were placed with no answer on the GAStech end of the line.</docText>

ELODIS, KRONOS:  A CITY IN NEED, part 



1998/03/21


This Article is the first advance of a three-part range the tackling growing problem of one fear of the community, government indictable offense, and the alarming influence of multinational companies on the country of Kronos.

ELODIS, Kronos - Nestled in the bending of the river Tiskele, the sun increase concerning the agriculture city of Elodis, gone pursuing those surrounding Mt shadow. Bouro cloaking.  Today, since they each day more than 250 years, the residents will increase to tend that the rich alluvial area country feeding for people of Kronos supplies.

Two weeks in former days I received a e-mail of an old friend, Pondo Reese, now the editor of the Elodis weekly day book, an agriculture document that the community serve round bending Tiskele. In its e-mail he described an once abundant area that now it is agitated by pollution, which solutions to a worsening problem wrestle to find.  I decided to examine.

We did not make the connection firstly, Reese told me then I him on its office met.  The gasbedrijf built a couple had been year back in 94, and our problems had started not rechtsweg.   After a couple harvests, we saw a fall in production.   We thought perhaps the only hiccup were, and improve the things would become.  Then the young young she-goats sick to be then started took we a harder can at what could changed be. 

The change proved to be international GAStech, an international company that by Sten Sanjorge Jr, bedrijfstycoon from Tethys in functioning are put.

Established in 1961, the company GAStech started had as a family matter which grants the local exchanging services in Tethys.  The two founders - SR and strict Fluss van Sten Sanjorge - found more profitable onbetrouwbare drilling to be, and started this way with a range environment calamities and financial scandals which Sanjorge eventual SR in an early sepulchre in functioning floated stalks and Fluss in a marginal role in its own company.  With the death of Sanjorge SR, the zoon took the rudder firmly of GAStech in its seizure and broadened its influence further far gone, eventually landing at the threshold of the small peaceful municipality of Elodis.

With a population of 6500, the most of residents of Elodis one imagine oneself themselves and twee-verhaal live on small agriculture companies.  A smaller number of families lives in the municipality along a head street with two markets, two hardware rises, one gaspost and a caf? where you buy lunch, can take your mail and a liter buys milk to house to bring.  The families have lived in Elodis for generations.

We have made a good for a long time living, Reese tell me. The population gestadig have increased.  The production of the plant has been well.  Mainly, the young young she-goats have not left for the city since they have a lot in other rural places.  We have a lot country which could be still developed. There was a future here for them.

I asked Reese me to help people meet it of who life has been influenced by the verrichtingen of GAStech.  He introduced me to a farmer of whom family had been here for different generations.  

I obtained Henk Bodrogi which in city in purchases make at the hardware rise of Osvaldo to repair a broken motor tractor.  Bodrogi have soya broad beans complete life have been treated, such as its father and their fathers. I asked him concerning its life on the agriculture company.

POK RALLY DRAWS THOUSANDS OF SUPPORTERS 

 

2009/03/08
 

ABILA, Kronos - Thousands of protesters carrying banners reading "Remember Juliana!" rallied in front of the Kronos government offices Saturday morning. She has become the heart-rending icon of a movement that has gained support from one end of Kronos to the other.  Karel took over POK leadership from Henk Bodrogi, whose ill health forced him down from the position.  Karel spoke eloquently about the beginnings of the POK campaign as a grassroots effort for clean water, to the dynamic movement it has become demanding improved government transparency and accountability.  We know these corporations are generating records profits at the expense of Kronos, but we see none of the promised improvements.</docText>

Global disasters drain charity coffers

14 November 1999
New appeals campaigns on the horizon to maintain liquidity.
Aid agencies have warned that the monetary and food needs have increased worldwide and that they may not be able to meet basic needs.
The UN Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs says that 15 million people remain in need of vital goods and services, because the number and severity of crises has resulted in a lack of "food, healthcare, and access to livelihoods."
One new aid group, CARING Singapore has been recently formed In response to the conflict in Kosovo.  Dr. Jayala Mahmed was unable to find an existing organization to sponsor her to volunteer her medical services there.  CARING Singapore has sent five missions to Kosovo to provide mobile medical care.  They have also launched a fundraising effort in collaboration with the governments of Malaysia.  "We stand ready to help, but funding is difficult to find," stated Dr. Mahmed. "So much is needed but so much has already been spent."
Thirteen people were injured on Tuesday in Izmit, Turkey, as people mobbed a government relief convoy, officials said.  Some 20,000 people are feared dead in the two earthquakes that have occurred this year.  CARING Singapore has dispatched relief teams to Turkey.
Yet, aid organizations are stretched to their limits.  Wellness for All assisted ad-hoc emergency medical teams during the September earthquake in central Taiwan that measured 7.3 on the Richter scale.  "The response from the Emergency Teams was impressive, but uncoordinated," stated a Wellness for All spokesperson.  "We were never sure if we were headed to locations most desperate.  We soon ran out of medicines and funds to support our aid teams and had to return home."  While the global press reported over 2500 people were killed and 100,000 buildings were destroyed, local press reported people felt they were being properly cared for and declined relief aid. 
The Global Emergency Disaster Organization report their members are doing all they can to get aid through to earthquake victims, but they need a huge injections of funds to do so.  
Jim Cordon, from the disaster relief charity FoodSupport told the times "I think that the lack of funds are responsible for an increase of attacks on food convoys, consequently deterring a lot of aid agencies from getting in there."</docText>

ELODIS PROTESTS TURN TO RIOTS AND ARRESTS 

24 September 2005

ELODIS, Kronos - The Protectors of Kronos (POK) continue to protest against the Kronos Government and GAStech International alleging pollution, water contamination and a lack of a government response. Lately the protests have turned violent escalating into rioting largely directed at the Tiskele Bend site.

The latest event involved POK protesters forming a human chain to block the entrance of GAStech's Tiskele Bend site. After the recent rioting, government officials had no choice, but to round up the protesters and arrest them for trespassing.

Government spokesman Rufus Drymiau commented, "These sort of violent actions by members of the Protectors of Kronos are counterproductive. We are working closely - the government and GAStech - to ensure that all environmental issues are resolved."

Several instances of rioting in and around Elodis have been reported including the trashing of government buildings, rock throwing, and tire burnings. Police have responded swiftly and decisively. The various skirmishes with police have ended in arrests.</docText>

1915 UPDATE - GAStech employee Edvard Vann was "allowed to leave" after nearly six hours of interrogation by police, government, and GAStech officials. Vann was questioned and released about fifteen minutes ago and instructed not to leave town. Vann was visibly angry about the confusion, which apparently stemmed from the similarity of his name and known members of the Protectors of Kronos.
Vann said he was "instructed not to communicate with the press, but I feel I have to stress my innocence. I have nothing to do whatsoever with any members of the terrorist group POK."</docText>

POK LEADER KAREL ARRESTED
Petrus Gerhard
12 March 2009

ABILA, Kronos - In another unconscionable move against the citizens of Kronos, earlier today police arrested POK leader Elian Karel on spurious tax evasion charges.  He was led - manacled - from a meeting of the Protectors of Kronos in Elodis, a rural township west of Abila.
Demonstrating his trademark humor, Karel lifted his wrists and joked to his supporters as he is led away, "I guess I shouldn't have sent the President those cases of bottled water for his birthday."
Karel is the leader of the Protectors of Kronos, an alliance of Kronos citizens from Elodis that has demanded the government clean up the contaminated water caused by gas drilling in their community.
"We didn't ask for GAStech to come to our community," Karel spoke at a rally a few months ago.  "We didn't ask for our water to become undrinkable, for our children to become sick.  Neither Elodis nor the people of Kronos have received any benefit from the extraordinarily large amount of money that GAStech clears every year.  I ask:  Where is the money going?"
The police representative assured supporters who massed outside the police station that Karel would be treated humanely, but declined to answer questions or allow visitors to see Karel.
"He's a determined man," Karel's attorney Michale Kraft told me over the phone. "He'll fight these false charges and be out in a few days.  He'll probably complain about the jail food at the next POK rally." 
Kraft plans to meet with Karel Saturday morning.
Calls to the President and Minister of Justice offices were not immediately returned.</docText>

The port of Abila is known to be a point of transshipment for drugs coming the active Middle East and of Africa to heroin and the hachish from Europe in particular. However, drug connected arrests had remained punt during the decade spent until the recent increase.

The new general of Abila will have 350 beds, a substantial improvement of the 100 mere beds of the present old fashioned facility.  In addition, he will have a complete area of services of emergency, units of the care of the trauma and the burn, a psychiatric wing of the care, and four ultramodern surgical rooms.

Protestors Block Traffic to Tiskele Bend Fields 

 

2005/04/06
 

ABILA, Kronos - More than a dozen POK protesters were handcuffed and taken into custody by police Tuesday for blocking access to the Tiskele Bend fields.  Before police made the arrests shortly after 9 a.m., the protesters were told they were breaking the law for trespassing on government property, blocking access to government-owned land, and impeding lawful commercial traffic.  

 

The protesters arrived at the entrance to the Tiskele Bend site about 5:30 a.m. and locked arms across the road for about three hours, despite being asked to leave by police.  As traffic on the road began to back up, several truck drivers began to leave their vehicles and congregate near the protesters.  Tempers began to flare as the blockade persisted into the second hour, and the drivers started shouting and cursing at the protesters to move out of the road.  Police officers quickly moved in and arrested the POK protesters before the situation could escalate to violence.</docText>

GASTECH ADOPTS NEW LOGO 

 

2009/05/16
 

CENTRUM, Tethys - With great fanfare GAStech International's President and CEO Sten Sanjorge, Jr. spoke of the new logo - a tri-part blue flame - that is reminiscent of a leaf to "help position GAStech and its products as a clean fuel alternative." He also referenced that the tri-part flame represents the past, present, and future of the company in that by keeping "one eye on the past we know from where we came - our humble beginnings; asserted GAStech International's "blue flame is an enduring beacon of environmental responsibility, and a symbol of a clean energy business moving forward."  

 

This rebranding process and new logo seem to be in response to recent trouble the multi-national gas giant has been struggling with in Kronos including the February 19 protest at GAStech - Kronos' headquarters of 200 people who blocked entrance to the building, resulting in several arrests. The protest and others in and around Abila, the capital of Kronos, have been in response to alleged water contamination issues and a lack of Government and GAStech response. He deflected, "Today is a great day for GAStech.</docText>

Araullo Announces New Hospital Construction

21 November 1995

ABILA, Kronos - President Araullo announced today that his government is planning the construction of a new, modern Abila General Hospital.  The old Abila General Hospital, built in 1930, has outdated health care facilities and has suffered numerous electrical fires in the past decade.  Hospital Administrator Torsten Trucco lauded the government's action saying, "We've been trying to get funding to update our facilities for years, to no avail.  We have been living on borrowed time for quite a while now with the old boiler.  It's been pure luck that the old girl hasn't failed on us completely."

The new Abila General will have 350 beds, a substantial upgrade from the mere 100 beds of the current antiquated facility.  Additionally, it will have a full emergency services area, trauma and burn care units, a psychiatric care wing, and four ultra-modern surgical suites.  In his announcement of the new construction, Araullo said, "Our strategy of courting foreign investment is paying great dividends.  This new hospital is the first of many projects we plan to pursue to help upgrade our standard of living and modernize our lifestyle."</docText>

POK REPRESENTATIVES MEET WITH KRONOS MINISTER OF HEALTH 

 

1998/11/15
 

ABILA, Kronos - Representatives from the social activist group Protectors of Kronos (POK) met earlier this week with Cesare Nespola, Minister of Health to discuss resolutions to the water contamination that has plagued Elodis since the late 1990s.  He seemed to be very responsive to our request to establish improved health care in Elodis, and reverse the contamination responsible for so many of our illnesses." 

The POK formed in 1997 from a grassroots action group in response to the pollution of the Elodis water supply and the resultant sickness and deaths of local residents over the subsequent several years.</docText>

Tiskele Bend Gas Fields Larger Than First Thought
Donato Petri
13 March 1996

ABILA, Kronos - A press release from the Ministry of Interior today announced that the Tiskele Bend gas fields could be as much as 5 times larger than originally estimated.  When we contacted Minister Sarto's office for comment, he said, "We were astounded by the results of GAStech's recent survey of Tiskele Bend.  I mean, this is just huge for the people of Kronos.  We have already undertaken several large improvement projects like the port expansion and the new hospital that we would not otherwise have been able to do because of the taxes we are seeing from our foreign investments.  This news almost assures we'll be able to reap those same dividends for decades to come!"

It goes without saying that President Araullo's plan to lure foreign investment has been a defining moment in our history.  One hopes that those who had been so shortsighted as to oppose his plan have finally come to their senses.  We will say what they are too proud to say: Thank you, Mr. President.</docText>

However, there are still they that think found oneself that the prosperity for our bad is.  These people claim that the foreign investment for our country is bad that it dilutes our culture and undermines our values.  They claim that the aliens develop us for their own acquisition and that our government has little regard for the well-being of our people.  They are this way militant in their wrong-headed believe which they have manufactured claim that the foreign companies poison our children with their technology.  They are even to in foreign experts will have brought whom requirement our best interests with heart have to help their agenda against progress and prosperity for our people to spread out.

ELODIS, KRONOS:  HELP FROM AN UNEXPECTED SOURCE Part Two 

Petrus Gerhard 

1998/04/26
 

 

NOTE: This article is the second in a series, reprinted with permission from the Homeland Illumination.  Bodrogi has farmed soybeans his entire life, as did his father and their fathers. 

 "We've worked the land for a long time - maybe 200 years, maybe a bit more," Henk Bodrogi told me as he picked over a container of bolts, searching for the right size.  It took a while to figure out, then one of the city officers figured out to call in a water specialist.  When they tested it they said the water was contaminated." 

The water specialist turned out to be the international agency "Wellness For All", an international agency with a mission to bring healthy water to communities distressed by natural disasters, draught and - coincidentally - oil and gas development. Reynolds agreed to speak to me for a few minutes between meetings about their work in Elodis.  The Elodis drinking water comes from the Tiskele River, as does all the water for farming, so we looked for a source upstream.  The toxins are forming a subsurface plume that seeps into the Tiskele River from which the residents of Elodis draw their drinking water and irrigation for the crops." 

"When we didn't make headway with GAStech," Reynolds continued, "the community leaders decided to approach the government of Kronos for assistance.   Per our policy -and with permission from the Elodis leaders - we published the test results in an official public document.  The Elodis leaders then approached the government officials as citizens of a Kronesian community armed with the scientific analysis.</docText>

POK REPRESENTATIVES MEET WITH KRONOS MINISTER OF HEALTH

ABILA, Kronos - Representatives from the social activist group Protectors of Kronos (POK) met earlier this week with Cesare Nespola, Minister of Health to discuss resolutions to the water contamination that has plagued Elodis since the late 1990s.
"This was a productive meeting," POK leader Henk Bodrogi told the Homeland Illumination.  "I am greatly heartened by the interest the government is showing in suffering of the people of Elodis.  He seemed to be very responsive to our request to establish improved health care in Elodis, and reverse the contamination responsible for so many of our illnesses."
The POK formed in 1997 from a grassroots action group in response to the pollution of the Elodis water supply and the resultant sickness and deaths of local residents over the subsequent several years.</docText>

Michale Kraft, Karel's lawyer, released a statement asserting that the charges leveled against his client were "false" and that he hoped his client "would be released [from police custody] by week's end."

Police spokesman Adrien Carman responded the statement by Kraft, stating, "I think Mr. Kraft has underestimated the seriousness of his client's situation. We have been following his group closely for some time."

There is the immovable speculation with respect who was taken in the kidnapping and if president of GAStech and jr. of the CEO Sten Sanjorge were the target, since international GAStech has had still to make a declaration to the speculation of the pressure on the reasons for the kidnappers has been wild due to the recent news of the initial public offer of GAStech only for a month.



In this time nobody has demanded the responsibility of the kidnapping. Edvard Vann, a GAStech - the protector of security of Kronos that was interrogated and sent after 6 hours, gave the instructions that the protectors of Kronos were implied or at least suspected like being the authors behind today events.



An international executive of the greater security of GAStech has been in the site to support the investigation that helped to the department of the police of Abila and the officials of the government of Kronos.



The 20 of January were annual corporative meeting of GAStech with a reception of the government of Kronos to follow. Shortly after tomorrow the meeting finished in the 10:00, Abila that the cars of the body of firemen responded to the information of a fire in the office of GAStech.</docText>

GAStech Profile 

 

2013/02/22
 

It is the biggest company in Kronos, the third largest gas company on the planet, and it is fifty-three years old. In the past it has had a reputation as corrupt and environmentally harmful, but nowadays GAStech, the former Tethys-only business, is trying to earn the trust of international investors. 

It is an uphill task, and there is no certainty that Gastech has the ability to convince potential investors it has mended its ways, and is no longer rooted in the eco-hostile past. 

GAStech's pipeline operations are based in eastern Kronos, and there is close relationship with the Kronosian government. This is the heart of Kronos's pipeline business, where gas from the eastern gas fields is piped west towards the rest of Kronos, Tethys and Europe. 

GAStech does more than just pump gas. 

The head of GAStech, Sten Sanjorge, Jr, whose photo stares out from calendars and picture frames everywhere in the country, acknowledges the "state within a state" accusations, but argues that the company simply needs to look after its workers and the communities around them. The GAStech empire owns 2 thousand cows and 3 thousand pigs in its company farms, runs gyms, and offers subsidised holidays in Black Sea resorts for key employees. There is an argument, however, that the energy business is different from other industries, requiring energy corporations to operate in distinct ways. 

Working in far-off places with no previous infrastructure means oil and gas sites will always be, to some extent, company towns. GAStech certainly strives to ensure its employees can move in and out of these locations by operating a private fleet of four planes to ferry its staff the huge distances between sites.</docText>

TAX MEASURE DEFEATED, POK EFFORTS STALLED 

 

2001/03/22
 

Abila, Kronos - A measure to increase taxes on foreign oil and gas development proposed by Minister of Health Cesare Nespola was defeated by a wide margin last week in the General Assembly. 

This defeat is a harsh blow to the Protectors of Kronos, an Elodis group that was counting on this funding to provide healthcare and environment cleanup of their drinking and irrigation water. 

"We have a meeting planned with the Minister," Protectors of Kronos leader Henk Bodrogi told the Homeland Illumination. 

Bodrogi is the leader of the Protectors of Kronos, a grassroots environmental group with a mission to reverse the pollution caused by gas drilling in his hometown.</docText>

Profile:  Elian Karel 



2009/06/23


&lt;&lt;deleted the image of Elian Karel that spoke in a meeting in Abila>>

The voice of the protest for some, demagog for others, protective of popularist of the leader Elian Karel de Kronos became martyr and a point of the meeting for some; a figure of the disdain and rabblerousing for others, and a political preoccupation to the government of Kronosian, within a filled year event, accentuated by its suspicious death Friday. 

The leader of an environmental group forbearant of the activist, Karel had begun a trade name of the policy all his the own ones, that drove the POK in the projector of this nation of the island.

Supplied of fuel by a displeasure every greater time with the severe government of Kronosian, he began to lead the POK in a action-based organization, instead of whom he hoped his government to do aright of the things.

Reviving the live coals of the Julian Vann to campaign, the girl of 10 years who died of the diseases attributed to the industrial useless currents of the government-favored corporation of GASTech in 1998, Karel was arrested and sent in the jail that follows an POK-initiated human barricade in front of the headquarters of GAStech in May. Karel died Wednesday whereas it served time in jail. The government of Kronos rejects the commentary on the circumstances of his death.

Something charismatic, Karel could inspire to a crowd and draw the attention to the social and political agenda of POK.  It could also cosquillear the amused bone of his hearings.  Once, after the Jr of the CEO Sten Sanjorge de GAStech compared the POK to a group of the terrorist in an interview of the press, Karel quipped, "Sanjorge is a leader shining of GAStech.  You know because he takes to a scale with him the supermarket?  He heard that the prices of food in Abila are really high."

Nevertheless, its capacity to hook in last instance with the intimidated government of Kronos never had been clear.  She is also confused who will now take its layer in the POK goes that it.</docText>

Kronos Benefits from Foreign Investment
Lelio Masin
18 January 1998

ABILA, Kronos - Today is the fifth anniversary of President Araullo's visionary plan to bring foreign investment to Kronos, a bold act that has reaped tremendous benefits for our fair country.  Today's Abila is a bustling metropolis full of new cars, new construction, gleaming office buildings, and modern conveniences.  Gone are the potholed streets, run-down factories, tired storefronts, and sad marketplaces of the past.  Today's Abila is a city of industry, a place of commerce and investment, a place of opportunity and success.  Prosperity has come to Kronos, and we are all the better for it.

However, there are still those who wrongly think that prosperity is bad for us.  These people claim that foreign investment is bad for our country, that it is diluting our culture and undermining our values.  They claim that the foreigners are exploiting us for their own gain and that our government has little regard for the welfare of our people.  They are so militant in their wrong-headed beliefs that they have fabricated claims that the foreign companies are poisoning our children with their technology.  They have even gone so far as to have brought in foreign "experts" who claim to "have our best interests at heart" to help spread their agenda against progress and prosperity for our people.  The hypocrisy of bringing in foreigners to tell us that opening our country to foreigners is bad for us is ludicrous and is obviously a sign of mental illness in those who oppose our modernization.</docText>

Annual POK Rally Ends in Riot, Again 

 

2013/06/20
 

ABILA, Kronos - POK members held their annual demonstration in Abila yesterday.  A larger than usual crowd gathered in front of the Capitol building, waving signs holding pictures of Elian Karel and Juliana Vann, who were painted as POK "martyrs".   

 

Police and government security forces set up between the protestors and the Capitol building in a show of force, hoping to prevent the kind of chaos that occurred during last year's riot.  However, after several hours of chanting and speeches, tempers in the crowd flared and protestors rushed the police line.  The police forces were forced to use tear gas, pepper spray, water cannons, and rubber bullets to subdue the crowd and protect property.  In spite of their heroic efforts, the protestors managed to break some windows, damage several police vehicles, and injure three officers.</docText>

POK Anniversary Rally Ends in Riot
Marcella Trapani
20 June 2012

ABILA, Kronos - POK members held a large demonstration in Abila yesterday.  Several dozen of their supporters held sit-ins in front of the capitol building and the presidential manor, while others took to the streets with their signs and chants.  Protestors handed out flyers to bystanders that alleged that our government is corrupt and "the rich get richer on the backs of the poor".  Police called for the peaceful end to the sit-ins, but were answered with a barrage of rocks and bottles from the crowd.  The violence escalated into a full blown riot and police were forced to use tear gas, pepper spray, water cannons, and beanbags shot from shotguns to control the crowd.  

By the time the crowds finally dispersed, several government buildings had been vandalized, two police vehicles were ablaze, and the streets were littered with trash and broken glass.  Several protestors and police were injured, including one heroic police officer who was stabbed by a crazed protestor.  The officer, whose name has been withheld for security reasons, is in critical condition at Abila General Hospital.</docText>

20 January 2014

Update, 5:30 PM:  We have several reports from GAStech employees that confirm a kidnapping took place, but at this time there is no information on who was involved.  Unofficial reports from the police indicate that they believe the Protectors of Kronos (POK) are behind the kidnapping and that they requested government assistance with the investigation.  We have received no information which could confirm the POK's role in this alleged kidnapping, but note that they have grown increasingly violent over the past 5 years.</docText>

Profile:  Elian Karel  

 

2009/06/22
 

&lt;&lt;deleted image of Elian Karel speaking at a rally in Abila>> 

Voice of protest for some, popularist demagogue for others, Protectors of Kronos leader Elian Karel became a martyr and a rallying point for some; a figure of disdain and rabblerousing for others, and a political concern to the Kronosian government, within an event filled year, accented by his suspicious death on Friday.  

The leader of a forbearant environmental activist group, Karel had started a brand of politics all his own, that propelled the POK into the spotlight of this island nation. 

Fueled by a growing dissatisfaction with the heavy-handed Kronosian government, he started driving the POK into an action-based organization, instead of one waiting for their government to make things aright. 

Resurrecting the embers of the Juliana Vann campaign, the 10 year old girl who died from illnesses attributed to the government-favored GASTech corporation's industrial waste streams in 1998, Karel was arrested and thrown in jail following a POK-initiated human roadblock in front of GAStech headquarters in May. Karel died Wednesday while serving time in jail. 

Rather charismatic, Karel was able to inspire a crowd and draw attention to the POK social and political agenda. likened the POK to a terrorist group in a press interview, Karel  quipped, "Sanjorge is a brilliant leader of GAStech.</docText>

ELODIS, KRONOS: WILL THE GOVERNMENT RESPOND IN TIME? Part Three
Petrus Gerhard
15 May 1998




This article is the last installment of a three-part series addressing the growing problem of one community's anguish, government malfeasance, and the alarming influence of multinational corporations on the country of Kronos.
Pondo Reese, editor of the Elodis Weekly Journal, stands at his window, looking out toward the sun setting on the Tiskele River.  I've asked him to tell me about the involvement of the government of Kronos in the deeply troubling account of a community's struggle for protection from those who should help them the most: their elected officials, against those who would poison their children and the country's food.
"It took a long time for anyone to respond," Reese tells me of their struggle.  "Henk Bodrogi - the man you met - didn't give up.  He called every department that could possibly be associated with our problem:  interior, justice, foreign affairs, health.    Henk and a few other residents made several trips to Abila trying to get someone to listen.  Finally, a sympathetic person from the Ministry of Health answered the door, so that's where we started."
Reese then describes months of meetings at which the government officials demanded documents proving their case:  health and crop yield statistics, the scientific test results from Wellness For All, and medical records.
"It's been frustrating.  We bring the documents they want, and then they want to confirm the results, or tell us to provide additional information or have closed door meetings.  We're currently in the process of negotiating a date for a hearing at the Ministry of Health to present our petition for assistance."
Has it been worth it?
"You tell me," Reese nods out his window.  I look over his shoulder to see a group of children kicking a soccer ball in the dust.
"What choice do we have?"</docText>

GAStech CEO Sten Sanjorge is celebrating the successful initial public offering of his company, which took place last month.   When they leave here the GAStech executives will travel to the capital building where they will meet with President Kapelou and several of his Ministers and Council members.  A private celebration of their successful alliance is planned to take place later today.  One can't help but wonder how much healthcare could be provided with only half the funds used to orchestrate this spectacle. 20 Jan 2014</docText>

ELODIS, KRONOS:  A TOWN IN NEED, Part One 

Petrus Gerhard 

1998/03/20
 

NOTE: This article is the first in a series, reprinted with permission from the Homeland Illumination. 

ELODIS, Kronos - Nestled in the bend of the Tiskele River, the sun rises over the farming town of Elodis,  chasing away the shadows cloaking nearby Mt.  The two founders - Sten Sanjorge Sr and Hank Fluss - found wildcat drilling to be more lucrative, and thus began a series of environmental disasters and financial scandals that eventually ran Sanjorge Sr into an early grave and drove Fluss into a marginal role in his own company.  With the death of Sanjorge Sr, the son took the helm of GAStech firmly in his grasp and broadened its influence further afield, eventually landing at the doorstep of the small peaceful township of Elodis.  A smaller number of families live in the township along a main street with two markets, two hardware stores, one gas station and a caf??????here you can buy lunch, pick up your mail and purchase a litre of milk to bring home.  Families have lived in Elodis for generations.</docText>

WHO BRINGS A GUN TO A SIT IN? 

 

2013/06/21
 

ABILA, Kronos - Yesterday, as they have each June 19th for the past three years supporters of Protectors of Kronos rallied demanding much the same as they have in the past fourteen years:  an end to the corruption of the Kronos government officials and the cleanup of the toxic waste dump that has become the Tiskele River near Elodis. They handed out information on flyers printed and donated by local businesses about the lifestyle incongruities between today's elected officials and those of a few years ago. Demonstrators held posters of POK martyrs and chanted for social and economic parity, while black-clad members of the Abila Police formed faceless lines of shields, batons and side arms surrounding the crowds.  The rally had been publicized as a peaceful gathering of citizens to bring their concerns to the public consciousness.  The most dangerous item in their hands was a picture of a sweet-faced ten year dead old girl - Juliana Vann who died in 1998 of cancer caused by the benzene in her drinking water. 

Despite these heavy-handed efforts, as groups of people slipped through the barricades and moved through the streets to bring their message to the citizens of Kronos.   

How can these officials - hypothetically getting by on public salaries - afford the second homes, large boats and luxury automobiles they flaunt?</docText>

PROTESTS SWELL IN ABILA IN RESPONSE TO CALLS TO ACTION

ABILA, Kronos - Thousands of people lined the roads on Thursday in a display of antigovernment solidarity.

Among the demonstrators was Mestache Vardshvna, 23, from the west coast of Kronos.   "We're trying to get the attention of our government," he told the Homeland Illumination.  "This is important, so I took time off from work to be a part of this important event."

He was one of many who wielded their power of free speech to voice their concern with the current lack of government transparency with public monies.

 "They need to be aware that we know what they're doing," added Vardshvna.  "You can't just steal our money and think you can get away with it."

Posters with colorful images of Elian Karel and Juliana Vann were reminders of the heavy toll already paid by leaders and innocents.  Karel was the prior leader of the Protectors of Kronos before his premature death in 2009.  His death, thought to be a murder by many, prompted annul rallies to bring the message of the Protectors of Kronos to the public.  Juliana Vann died in 1998 of cancer caused by environmental toxins in her drinking water.  She had just turned ten years old.</docText>

WRAP UP OF EVENTS AT GASTECH

20 January 2014

ABILA, Kronos - A long tense day of conflicting reports and confusing information has come to an end. What we know for certain is that 14 GAStech employees are not only missing, but kidnapped as confirmed by a Kronos Government source. At this time it is unclear who the missing are and whether they are citizens of Kronos of Tethys, as many GAStech employees are Tethan.

There is still speculation regarding who was taken in the kidnapping and whether GAStech President and CEO Sten Sanjorge Jr. was the target, given that GAStech International has yet to make a statement to the press. Speculation about the motives of the kidnappers has been rampant due to the recent news of the GAStech Initial Public Offering only a month ago.

At this time no one has claimed responsibility for the kidnapping. Edvard Vann, a GAStech - Kronos security guard who was interrogated and released after 6 hours, gave the indication that the Protectors of Kronos were involved or at least suspected as being the perpetrators behind today's events.

A GAStech International senior security executive has been on site to support the investigation aiding the Abila Police Department and Kronos Government officials.

January 20th was GAStech's annual corporate meeting with a Kronos Government reception to follow. Shortly after the morning meeting ended at 10:00, Abila Fire Department trucks responded to reports of a fire at the GAStech office.</docText>

ELODIS, KRONOS:  A CITY IN the NECESSITY, divides one



1998/03/21


This article is the first installation of a series of three parts that deals with the problem every greater time an anguish of the community, the criminal fact of the government, and the alarming influence of multinational corporations in the country of Kronos.

ELODIS, Kronos - Nestled in the curve of the river of Tiskele, the sun rises excessive the city that cultivates of Elodis, persecuting far the shades that disguise TM. next Bouro.  Today, as they have newspaper by more than 250 years, the residents will rise to tend to the rich Earth of floodplain that provides the food for the people of Kronos.

Two weeks I previously received an email of an old friend, Pondo Reese, now the editor of the weekly newspaper of Elodis, a paper of the agriculture that served to the community around the curve of Tiskele. In his email it described once generous region now caused sorrow by the contamination, fighting to find solutions to a worsening problem.  He decided to investigate.

"We did not make the connection at the outset," Reese we said to me when I satisfied with him in its office.  "The company of the gas had been posteriora part of some years constructed in '94, and our problems did not begin immediately.   After a pair of harvests, we saw a declination in the production.   We think that perhaps hiccup was right, and the things would obtain better.  Then when obtaining begun the cabritos ill we done one more a glance harder what could have changed. "

The change turned out to be international GAStech, an international corporation directed by Sten Sanjorge Jr, tycoon of the business outside Tethys.

Established in 1961, the corporation of GAStech began like had business family who provided services that carried the premises in Tethys.  Both founders - Mr. and hank Fluss de Sten Sanjorge - perforating savage found to being more lucrative, and began therefore a series of environmental disasters and financial scandals that worked Mr. de Sanjorge in an early tomb and lead possible Fluss in a marginal paper in their own company.  With the death of Mr. de Sanjorge, the son took the rudder from GAStech firmly in his grasping and widened his influence more far to the distant spot, possible landing in the threshold of small the Pacific municipality of Elodis.

With a population of 6500, most of the residents of Elodis they live in houses one and on two-history in small farms.  A smaller number of families lives in the municipality throughout a main street with two markets, two warehouses of the hardware, a powerboat and a coffee where you can buy lunch, take his mail and buy a liter of milk to bring the home.  The families have lived in Elodis for the generations.

"We have made a good life during long time," Reese we say to me. "The population has been increasing constantly.  The vegetal production has been good.  For most, the cabritos have not gone away for the city as they have in many of other rural places.  We have many of earth that could still be developed. There was a future for them here."

I requested Reese to help me to satisfy the people who lives have been affected by the operations of GAStech.  It introduced a farmer to he who family had here been for several generations.  

I took for above with Henk Bodrogi in the city that made purchases in the warehouse of the hardware of Osvaldo to repair an broken tractor.  Bodrogi has cultivated the soybeans its whole life, like its father and his parents. I asked to him about its life in the farm.

GOVERNMENT CITES 'MINOR' CONTAMINATION NEAR ELODIS

15 October 1997

ABILA, Kronos - After continued complaints and appeals from the people of Elodis government officials acknowledge minor contamination in and around the rural township in a report on their investigation into the townspeople's health issues. However, the government report stops short of blaming GAStech International and its Tiskele Bend site 20 km upstream as the people of Elodis assert. 

The government report cites no root cause or causes can be determined at this time with more research and investigations needed. Indeed, "pointing a finger of blame at this time would be hasty and most likely detrimental to the investigation."

Though the report admits some contamination it goes on the qualify the level stating, "The minor level of contamination is well within international health standards agreed upon by the Government of Kronos and GAStech International as negotiated in the Tiskele Bend site contract."

The Government of Kronos continues to offer well testing for concerned residents of Elodis as well as plans to further investigate the root causes of the illnesses in and around the township.</docText>

GAStech Profile 

 

2013/02/22
 

It is the biggest company in Kronos, the third largest gas company on the planet, and it is fifty-three years old. This is the heart of Kronos's pipeline business, where gas from the eastern gas fields is piped west towards the rest of Kronos, Tethys and Europe. 

The head of GAStech, Sten Sanjorge, Jr, whose photo stares out from calendars and picture frames everywhere in the country, acknowledges the "state within a state" accusations, but argues that the company simply needs to look after its workers and the communities around them. The GAStech empire owns 2 thousand cows and 3 thousand pigs in its company farms, runs gyms, and offers subsidised holidays in Black Sea resorts for key employees. GAStech certainly strives to ensure its employees can move in and out of these locations by operating a private fleet of four planes to ferry its staff the huge distances between sites.</docText>

The GOVERNMENT OF KRONOS PROJECTS TAX RELIEF TO ENCOURAGE the FOREIGN INVESTMENT



1992/12/12


ABILA, Kronos - the government of Kronos currently projects some of the tax relief most generous of the world for gas investments. This will help to create "the cheap energy" which can give to the country in the process of development a competing advantage and a leg upwards in the push of the government to modernize.



While the countries of high-income of Europe and the United States pack to benefit to exist and the potential gas layers, Kronos projects to provide incentives such as reducing the individual tax of corporation and, the preferential rates, and the exemptions from the payments as well as cheap, but from eager labor.



The government of Kronos launches the plan as gain-gain the situation given that the countries of high-income will fight to discover and to exploit the provisioning of never-reduction of fossile fuels and developing Kronos needs income, infrastructure, and cheap energy.

THE WHO IS THE DEMONSTRATORS 



2012/08/24


ABILA, Kronos - with the third anniversary to approach of the death of Elian Karel - previous member of the protectors of Kronos - the question is:  who are the demonstrators?  But not only who are they, which and because they are protesting? 



The protectors of Kronos or POK were founded on 1997 by the residents of rural Elodis in agreement with the opinion of the now late health for all (WFA), an international group of the security of the water. The POK was initiated to bring the attention to the clean editions of the water that surrounded Elodis to the government by Kronos and the world. The POK affirms that the site that it perforates international of the natural gas of the curve of GAStech Tiskele is the source of both the contamination of the potable water as well as the destruction of the traditional territories of labrant?o that surround Elodis. 



In 1998, WFA made test in the water of Elodis that finds stops levels of the benzene, arsenic of the tolueno and xylene, barium, chromium, lead and selenium. The test of a subsequent declaration sent by the attention and the pressure in the international government and GAStech brought WFA to the act. Nevertheless, with making fragments of WFA due to financing editions, the demands of the POK were not done case and downplayed to a great extent. 



Also in 1998, Julian Vann, of a ten years previously healthy one - the old girl died of a persistent disease, that WFA-financed demanded doctors was caused by the contamination of the water. The government of Kronos officially refuted the demand that mentioned the fragmentation of the WFA organization as it demonstrates of a nontrustworthy source that will not trust. He costs what costs, Julian he felt well to martyr of the first POK and has used the image of Julian in the Literature of the campaign since. 



Martyr secondly main of POK is Elian Karel, that died in 2009 whereas incarcerated of indetermine causes. Trumped upon loads affirms it to the POK was arrested ignition whereas the government of affirms it to Kronos was a radical and violent activist contracted the fiscal evasion. Karel been had implied with the POK from its beginning since his father, Jeroen Karel, were an original member.  The death of Elian Karel in 2009 was marked by spontaneous cases of the protest around Abila. The anniversary of its death, the 19 of June, has considered additional protests, demonstrations, uproars, and violence. 



The POK has been developed of pacific protests and demonstrations that demanded the action from the government to more violent activities including uproars whereas he demands that the government has done little nothing in the direction of the contamination, the envenenamientos, and the deaths undergone by his people. In date 2011, the government of Kronos has labeled the POK as "he threatens public".</docText>

2001/03/18

Ministrar Nespola said of the vote of the assembly, "I am disappointed by the vote, but they treated the assembly that the increase in tax would discourage the foreign investment in our sector of energy.  This is a misfortune to my program to help our rural municipalities, but I am not nothing if nonpersistent.  My office will send a measurement added reviewed of the tax to the assembly at the end of this year.  In addition, I will work with the office of president Kapelou to reconstruct the allocation of bottoms of present taxes of the gas and the oil to anticipate rural projects of the health."</docText>

EXPLOSION AND FIRE OF CURVE OF TISKELE



2000/08/18


ABILA, Kronos - a spark at GAStech International-had well with the site of curve of Tiskele fired gas methane several hundreds of feet at the bottom, involving an aerolite and the fire which burned during approximately an hour is the results of GAStech duel - research of government on the explosion and fire Sunday next morning. 



Four employees of GAStech suffered from the damage including/understanding the minor burns and the broken bones. Contrary to the preceding reports/ratios there were no death and no lack because of the incident. No resident was as well wounded and although some residents of Elodis were evacuated their houses research indicates that the evacuation was useless. 



While the official cause of the explosion is always being studied, the problem could have come from a defect in the wellhead itself. The wellheads of GAStech are ringed with the collars which placed pins functioning by them. One of the pins could have blown out of the collar, releasing the gas, which then contacted a spark.</docText>

POK LEADER KAREL ARRESTED
Petrus Gerhard
12 March 2009

ABILA, Kronos ? In another unconscionable move against the citizens of Kronos, earlier today police arrested POK leader Elian Karel on spurious tax evasion charges.  He was led - manacled ? from a meeting of the Protectors of Kronos in Elodis, a rural township outside Abila.
Demonstrating his trademark humor, Karel lifted his wrists and joked to his supporters as he is led away, ?I guess I shouldn?t have sent the President those cases of bottled water for his birthday.?
Karel is the leader of the Protectors of Kronos, an alliance of Kronos citizens from Elodis that has demanded the government clean up the contaminated water caused by gas drilling in their community.
?We didn?t ask for GAStech to come to our community,? Karel spoke at a rally a few months ago.  ?We didn?t? ask for our water to become undrinkable, for our children to become sick.  Neither Elodis nor the people of Kronos have received any benefit from the extraordinarily large amount of money that GAStech clears every year.  I ask:  Where is the money going??
The police representative assured supporters who massed outside the police station that Karel would be treated humanely, but declined to answer questions or allow visitors to see Karel.
?He?s a determined man,? Karel?s attorney Michale Kraft told me over the phone. ?He?ll fight these false charges and be out in a few days.  He?ll probably complain about the jail food at the next POK rally.? 
Kraft plans to meet with Karel Saturday morning.
Calls to the President and Minister of Justice offices were not immediately returned.</docText>

TEN-YEAR OLD ELODIS GIRL DIES OF POISONING
Petrus Gerhard
19 August 1998


Earlier this year a series Homeland Illumination published a series of articles about groundwater contamination in Elodis, and how the locals are demanding a government response for what is essentially Government of Kronos-sponsored pollution and poisoning of citizens.  This article is an update.
ELODIS, Kronos - Ten-year old Juliana Vann died yesterday afternoon, surrounded by her family and friends.  The cause of death was leukemia due to benzene poisoning.
Juliana had been sick for over a year.  Initially her family didn't realize that benzene poisoning was the cause of Juliana's problems.  After visits to many hospitals, a doctor associated with the international assistance organization Wellness For All recommended Juliana be tests for benzene poisoning.  At that point, however, the little girl's system was too damaged to recover.
The residents of Elodis have been pleading with the government of Kronos to take action against the pollution caused by the GAStech gas drilling operation just 20 km upstream from Elodis.
Juliana's death is but one of several deaths this rural township has suffered because of toxic waste being dumped into the Tiskele River by Tethys corporation GAStech.
Private funeral services will be held on August 21 in the family home.</docText>

WHO BRINGS A GUN TO A SIT IN?
Petrus Gerhard
20 June 2013

ABILA, Kronos - Yesterday, as they have each June 19th for the past three years supporters of Protectors of Kronos rallied demanding much the same as they have in the past fourteen years:  an end to the corruption of the Kronos government officials and the cleanup of the toxic waste dump that has become the Tiskele River near Elodis. 
The rally which took place at several venues across the city, including in front of President Kapelou's publically-owned home and in front of the Abila capital building.  The citizens gathered hoping their voices would be heard by their elected officials. They handed out information on flyers printed and donated by local businesses about the lifestyle incongruities between today's elected officials and those of a few years ago. Demonstrators held posters of POK martyrs and chanted for social and economic parity, while black-clad members of the Abila Police formed faceless lines of shields, batons and side arms surrounding the crowds.
On everyone's mind was the question:  Who brings a gun to a peaceful sit in?  The rally had been publicized as a peaceful gathering of citizens to bring their concerns to the public consciousness.  The most dangerous item in their hands was a picture of a sweet-faced ten year dead old girl - Juliana Vann who died in 1998 of cancer caused by the benzene in her drinking water.  
Why did the Kronos government feel the need to send a police brute squad?
Despite these heavy-handed efforts, as groups of people slipped through the barricades and moved through the streets to bring their message to the citizens of Kronos.  Flyers bringing messages of truth and justice were left on park benches, in coffee houses and on light poles.  
How can these officials - hypothetically getting by on public salaries - afford the second homes, large boats and luxury automobiles they flaunt?</docText>

2014/01/20
 

ABILA, Kronos - The Protectors of Kronos (POK) are suspected of kidnapping up to fourteen GAStech employees from their headquarters building earlier today.  Abila police quickly secured the building and interviewed the remaining GAStech employees.  One employee, Edvard Vann of Abila, was questioned for hours because he shares a family name with several known POK members.

A LOOK BACK AT A LIFE CUT TRAGICAL SHORT: ELIAN KAREL 

 

2011/06/21
 

ABILA, Kronos ?????? Two years ago yesterday Elian Karel died at age 28 in an Abila jail cell, purportedly of cardiac arrest.  After Karel??????s body was cremated and sent to his family in Elodis, the Abila Chief of Police closed the case and has declined to answer questions about Karel??????s death stating that ??????we are satisfied the death was of natural causes and will no longer be entertaining inquiries.?????? 

As reported at the time of Karel??????s death, several people close to the investigation reported that Karel??????s body showed signs of blunt force trauma, abrasions and lacerations which were not consistent with the cause of death reported by the police. 

Police have denied anything unusual happened in Karel??????s death and city officials claim the accusations of murder and wrongful death are asserted by POK rabble-rousers attempting to incite instability and violence.</docText>

    <docText>International Times

21 October 2013


Interpol has announced the formation of a new multi-country task force to combat the increasingly wide distribution of the drug methyldimethyl cathinone (MDMC).  Heading the task force is Senior Inspector Robert Loblaw, a veteran officer who led the very successful Tethys Counterdrug Team.  He is optimistic that he can identify the source.

"These designer drugs have certain clues as to their origin," Loblaw told the Times in an interview.  "Every time the recipe is changed, it leaves clues as to who made it.  It's like a pedigree."

This particular blend of the drug MDMC, also known by its street names "cotton candy", "spice dreams" and "Tulip Blossom", was found previously only in Asteria but has made its way to the streets of Tethys and other international countries.

"I'll be looking hard at the activities of the Asterian People's Army," Loblaw said.  "Our previous investigations pointed to them as the source of this particular formulation."

The Asterian People's Army (APA) is a paramilitary organization which has been engaged in terrorist activities funded through its criminal enterprises, which include drug trafficking.  In recent years the APA has sought to build their brand through websites and the publication of a professional, high-quality magazine called "Arise".

Senior Inspector Loblaw says the Tethys public statistics indicate MDMC is a growing problem with the country's youth.  "An increase in mental health problems, including hallucinations and paranoia, accompanied by violent behavior and a marked increase in suicide rates are only a few of the indicators of the usage of this designer drug."

"As a first step we have alerted port officials to be on the lookout for suspicious shipments of insecticides and detergent, both similar in appearance to MDMC."</docText>

Abila police break up sit-in turned violent at the presidential manor 

20 June 2012

Traffic snarled around the city as Abilians struggle to get to work amid vandalism and looting
Early on Tuesday police stormed the front of the presidential mansion and the capital building, breaking up a sit in by the Protectors of Kronos.
Other activist groups have joined the protesting faction in solidarity and a bigger rally was predicted for later in the day.
The conservative Kronos government used an emergency law to threaten the protestors with arrest unless they dispersed and returned to work.  The row is over environmental issues the POK holds the government and the gas giant GAStech international responsible.
The rallies had begun peacefully, however more destructive activities have escalated as the crowds became more restless. 
Signs among the protester called for government change and social equality.  Images of Juliana Vann, the 10 year old girl who died from illnesses attributed to the industrial giant GAStech international served as rallying points.
People heading to a pro-government counter-rally were attacked by POK supporters, and later shots were fired.  
Tuesday was the third anniversary of the mysterious death of Elian Karel, a popular leader of the POK who died in prison. 
Later in the day, what had been a largely peaceful demonstration turned violent when the crowd started vandalizing government buildings and the presidential homestead.  
A group of younger protestors attacked vehicles, smashing windows.  Minor injuries were reported. 
Police reinforcements were sent to the area and blocked roads, and skirmishes between the police and protestors broke out. 
Police used tear gas to break up the unruly crowd.  Government spokesmen complemented the security forces for their handling of the "gangs of criminals" disrupting the peace.</docText>

The perspicacity of an expert: prosperity as foreign PRESIDENT in Kronos 

2014/03/26
January 17, 1995



The Fluss hank is PRESIDENT de GAStech, the principal industry of Krono during more than 15 years, after its discovery of its immense gas layers close to the town of Elodis.

Fluss, functioned with dozen foreign Presidents during years. However, it has humble beginnings as a gas and oil prospector in Tethys. 

It spoke at times about the features about a chief successful in Kronos and which foreign Presidents can envisage in the market. 

Q: What the foreign Presidents can they wait when they come in Kronos?

A: the economic environment changed since the Eighties. It is much more difficult to succeed today. The foreign Presidents must play in bottom of their hopes. There is no easy victory in Kronos. Competition among Kronosian and foreign companies is hard. It is difficult to gain the hearts and the spirits of the population.

But there is less of difference than people think between the culture of Kronosian and, culture of Tethian of word. The personnel of Kronos function just like hard, they are respectful of their work and have the same desire for success. They can also appreciate the effective communication and a gifted chief.

Which foreign chief must make is to learn how to communicate the "manner of Kronosian" and to take time to include/understand their personnel.

Q: Can you work out?

A: There are many cultural differences while communicating. [To consider] notes. The foreign Presidents are always confused and frustrated when they send a note [with somebody in Kronos] and expect a simple response of yes/No Instead of that they obtain a very long answer which does not answer their initial question.

The people of Kronos do not like to take the responsability. They are frightened to lose their work and do not like to be forced in saying something which they do not want with. The foreign Presidents must take account of this and have to take time to include/understand how to communicate.

Patience is key. Transparency can be an excellent manner of coming to end this. It is a European value which Kronosians are very sensitive to. To impose on a company can transform with the voyage of a foreign President into Kronos an experiment much more pleasant.

Q: What the challenges of force are they a foreign PRESIDENT can they face on the arrival in Kronos?



A: Sometimes in fact the simplest things can be most provocative, like obtaining from A with B in a taxi. To be able to obtain around easily is taken for granted and not being able to make thus creates a great direction of the insecurity. In Kronos you are never sure if your driver drops to you to far with the address envisaged. This can seem as a small question but daily it is very tiring.

Another ends up knowing your team and with which you work. Just often foreign of stage of Presidents in addition to plane and in an office completely of the colleagues of Kronos. They do not have any idea which they are, how they work or as they qualified are. This can be muddling. 

The Presidents must take time to speak with their personnel, of the administrators to the drivers of truck and to include/understand their new environment before they test them and control.

Q: Can you give some ends on the way in which a foreign PRESIDENT can prepare?

A: the first thing that I would say is to prepare your family. They can find it difficult to adapt to the new environment of operation. This can affect the personal life. The family and the work of mixture are practical very current here. The people of Kronos work of overtime and socializes with their colleagues. It is very different from Tethys where there is a clear border between work and the family.

The foreign Presidents should also carry out how hard competition is and how much hard work must be put inside to succeed -- often much more than in their countries of origin. The language is a great question.

[But] anyhow much prepare you, the true experiment to work and to live in Kronos will always astonish you.

Q: How much difficult - or easy - is it to be a foreign PRESIDENT in Kronos?

A: Generally, I think that being a PRESIDENT is hard. There is much pressure, the environment is hard and it is difficult to find a balance with your personal life.

When a team of Kronos hears them that a PRESIDENT comes from overseas suppose it is a problem. But, culturelement they do not have a question with foreigners. 

Q: Are there situations in which to be a foreign director is really an advantage?

A: This question really depends on the person and how much they invest to include/understand the country and the culture. If they do not make any effort locate then it is a Net handicap. But in certain negotiations or certain questions such as the goods of luxury, the foreign Presidents can be an advantage. They can bring another point of view, facilitate the process.

Sometimes the foreign PRESIDENT with the best knowledge of an industry and can bring the access to the markets of overseas. This can be a tangible asset.</docText>

Marcella Trapani
30 August 2001


ABILA, Kronos - Five young people were arrested yesterday for protesting near the entrance to the Tiskele Bend fields as they called for government action to address their environmental concerns about GAStech's operations at the site.  The protestors, members of the activist group "Protectors of Kronos", held signs reading: "Drilling Poisoned Our Water" and "Remember Juliana", referring to 10 year old Juliana Vann, who has become an icon for the Protectors of Kronos since her death in 1998.  The protestors were arrested after one young man threw his sign at a government vehicle, cracking its window and startling the occupants.  Police spokesman Adrien Carman said of the arrests, "We decided to shut the protest down before the POK members escalated to further violence.  They were getting pretty animated out there."

"These 'Protectors of Kronos' are really a fringe minority of people against the extraction of fossils fuels in our country," said Government spokesman Carmine Gurganus.  "The people of Kronos have overwhelmingly been for the development of our natural resources and all have benefited from the resultant economic growth.  These activists clearly don't understand the whole picture."</docText>

Kronos Benefits from Foreign Investment 

 

1998/01/19
 

ABILA, Kronos - Today is the fifth anniversary of President Araullo's visionary plan to bring foreign investment to Kronos, a bold act that has reaped tremendous benefits for our fair country.  These people claim that foreign investment is bad for our country, that it is diluting our culture and undermining our values.  The hypocrisy of bringing in foreigners to tell us that opening our country to foreigners is bad for us is ludicrous and is obviously a sign of mental illness in those who oppose our modernization.</docText>

THREATS ISSUED BY POK

8 March 2012

ABILA, Kronos - Letters purported to be from the Protectors of Kronos (POK) have been received by Vincent Kapelou, Minister of Health and nephew of President Kapelou. The threatening letters appear to be the empty threats of an attention-seeking organization and nothing more.

Mr. Kapelou said, "Chances are this is nothing, but we're not going to take any chances." Nonetheless he has doubled the size of his personal security force in response to the letters.

These sorts of threats only reinforce the fact that the POK are a "public threat" to quote President Kapelou.</docText>

ELODIS, KRONOS:  THE GOVERNMENT WILL RESPOND IN TIME? Part three



1998/05/17








This article is the installation passed of a series of three parts that deals with the problem every greater time an anguish of the community, the criminal fact of the government, and the alarming influence of multinational corporations in the country of Kronos.

Pondo Reese, editor of the weekly newspaper of Elodis, is stopped in its window, watching towards outside towards the sun that fixes to the river of Tiskele.  I have requested that he says to me on the implication of the government of Kronos in the deeply worrisome account of the fight of a community for the protection against which they must help them more: its chosen civil employees, against whom they would poison his children and the food of the country.

"It took from long term so that any person responds," Reese says to me of its fight.  "Henk Bodrogi - the man who you satisfied - did not give for above.  It called each department that could possibly be associated to our problem:  outer interior, justice, subjects, health.    Henk and some other residents made several trips to Abila that tried to be able somebody to listen.  Finally, a comprehensive person of the ministry of the health answered the door, so that is where we began. "

Then Reese describes months of the meetings in which the officials of the government demanded the documents that proved their case:  statistic of the health and the harvest, the scientific test resultses of the health for all, and medical files.

"It has been frustrating.  We bring the documents that wish, and then they wish to confirm the results, or they say to us to provide the additional information or to have closed meetings of the door.  We are at the moment in course of negotiation of a date for a hearing in the ministry of the health to present/display our request for the aid."

 Has been worthy of her?

"You say to me," the pitchings of Reese towards outside his window.  I watch on its shoulder to see a group of children who strike a ball of soccer with the foot in the dust.

A GLANCE BEHIND WITH SHORTS OF TRAGEDY OF CUT OF THE LIFE: ELIAN KAREL



2011/06/22


ABILA, Kronos - two years ago of yesterday Elian Karel died at age 28 in a cell of prison of Abila, supposedly of stop.  It had been stopped three months former for incidental expense of tax avoidance and lefts to be delayed in a cell of prison without more judicial action.  Its agent, Michale Kraft make several aspects in front of the court require that the contour of government that their detail charges, and Karel release.  Kraft had concluded an agreement with the government that expenses would be reduced and Karel is released while waiting for a test, but Karel died during two days before it was to go freely.

The questions are delayed, however, about the way of died of Karel.  Requests of information were met insurances that the police force - whose Karel guard was inside per hour of its death - would make very possible to carry out a thorough research.

This "complete research" lasted every two weeks, including time when it took the coroner of town of Abila to lose the original files of autopsy.  After the body of Karel was incinerated and sent to its family in Elodis, the chief of Abila of the &lt;name> of police force closed the bag and refused to answer questions about the death of Karel declaring that "we are satisfied death were normal causes and will not amuse any more of the investigations."

As paid per hour of died of Karel, several people close to research reported that the body of Karel showed signs of trauma blunted of force, abrasions and lacerations what were not formed with the cause of the death brought back by the police force.  These confidential sources since moved sector and were inalienable for the contact.

The police force refused with something not very common product in the death of Karel and the civils servant of city claim the charges of the murder and unjustified death are affirmed by POK brew-rousers to try to encourage instability and violence.

Yesterday the morning of June 19, a small group of defenders of POK collected in front of the police station of Abila, holding of the photographs of Elian, and another young martyrdom, Juliana Vann, ten years - the old maid who died in 1998 of cancer caused by benzene toxins in her drinking water.  

"Both died because of the lies of government and the corruption," a man indicated to me who asked that its named either retained because of the preoccupations with a revenge of police force.  "Juliana died because Kronos made it possible GAStech to poison our water, and dead Elian because it tried to bring the justice of Juliana.  When it finishes?"

Others, a larger crowd had collected the front day in park close to city to bring the public conscience about these same questions.  Among the speeches and the music, I heard the same message of the year before:  "To remember Juliana! To remember Elian!"</docText>

Added Taxes on Oil, Gas Development Defeated in General Assembly 
Eva Thayer
17 March 2001

ABILA, Kronos - A motion to increase taxes on oil and gas development by an additional 10% was defeated today in the General Assembly by a vote of 77 to 23.  The proposed tax increase, championed by Minister of Health Cesare Nespola, was to provide specific funding for health care, clean water projects, and health education for rural areas.  Minister Nespola said of the Assembly vote, "I'm disappointed by the vote, but the Assembly was concerned that the increase in tax would discourage foreign investment in our energy sector.  This is a setback to my program to help our rural townships, but I am nothing if not persistent.  My office will be sending a revised added tax measure to the Assembly later this year.  Additionally, I will work with President Kapelou's office to restructure the allocation of funds from current gas and oil taxes to provide for rural health projects."</docText>

Profile:  Elian Karel 

22 June 2009

&lt;&lt;deleted image of Elian Karel speaking at a rally in Abila>>
Voice of protest for some, popularist demagogue for others, Protectors of Kronos leader Elian Karel became a martyr and a rallying point for some; a figure of disdain and rabblerousing for others, and a political concern to the Kronosian government, within an event filled year, accented by his suspicious death on Friday. 
The leader of a forbearant environmental activist group, Karel had started a brand of politics all his own, that propelled the POK into the spotlight of this island nation.
Fueled by a growing dissatisfaction with the heavy-handed Kronosian government, he started driving the POK into an action-based organization, instead of one waiting for their government to make things aright.
Resurrecting the embers of the Juliana Vann campaign, the 10 year old girl who died from illnesses attributed to the government-favored GASTech corporation's industrial waste streams in 1998, Karel was arrested and thrown in jail following a POK-initiated human roadblock in front of GAStech headquarters in May. Karel died Wednesday while serving time in jail. The government of Kronos refuses comment on the circumstances of his death.
Rather charismatic, Karel was able to inspire a crowd and draw attention to the POK social and political agenda.  He could also tickle the funny bone of his audiences.  Once, after GAStech CEO Sten Sanjorge Jr. likened the POK to a terrorist group in a press interview, Karel  quipped, "Sanjorge is a brilliant leader of GAStech. Do you know why he takes a ladder with him to the supermarket?  He heard that food prices in Abila are really high."
However, his ability to engage ultimately with the strong armed Kronos government had never been clear.  It is also unclear who will take his mantle in the POK now he is gone.</docText>

Kronos' oil and gas industry has warned it faces its "biggest challenge in 20 years" due to the low levels of exploration.

20 February 2012

Government energy officials said only 15 wells were drilled last year.
That was despite strong levels of investment, reaching a record last year and sustained this year.
Exploration drilling was down from 26 wells six years ago, only sufficient to recover a fraction of the estimated oil and gas remaining in the countries oil and gas fields.
"Kronos' fields contain an abundance of oil and gas yet to be found and it is critical we find the means to turn the current state of exploration around" -Energy Minister Jules Jecovic
The annual activity survey by Oil and Gas Kronos found a rapid increase in production costs, up by 15% last year.
The average cost of extracting a barrel of oil was up by 27% in only a year, to reach K17.
The number of fields with cost per barrel above K30 has doubled in the last 12 months.
Rising costs were cited last week by GAStech, which is considering future investments in Norway and North America, rather than Kronos fields.
With rising costs, production tax payments to the Kronos Treasury are expected to fall from K3.5bn during the 2011-12 financial year to K2bn in the current year.
Following the rapid decline in oil and gas production from Kronos fields in recent years, the rate of fall slowed during 2012 - down by 8% to .83m barrels of oil per day, or its gas equivalent.

Jecovic stated "Kronos' fields contain an abundance of oil and gas yet to be found and it is critical we find the means to turn the current state of exploration around. Equipment availability and access to capital are the two main barriers noted by our Ministry."</docText>

ELODIS, KRONOS: WILL THE GOVERNMENT RESPOND IN TIME? 



1998/05/15


This article is the last installment of a three-part series addressing the growing problem of one community's anguish, government malfeasance, and the alarming influence of multinational corporations on the country of Kronos.  I've asked him to tell me about the involvement of the government of Kronos in the deeply troubling account of a community's struggle for protection from those who should help them the most: their elected officials, against those who would poison their children and the country's food. 

"It took a long time for anyone to respond," Reese tells me of their struggle.  "Henk Bodrogi - the man you met - didn't give up.  He called every department that could possibly be associated with our problem:  interior, justice, foreign affairs, health.  Finally, a sympathetic person from the Ministry of Health answered the door, so that's where we started." 

Reese then describes months of meetings at which the government officials demanded documents proving their case:  health and crop yield statistics, the scientific test results from Wellness For All, and medical records.  We bring the documents they want, and then they want to confirm the results, or tell us to provide additional information or have closed door meetings.  We're currently in the process of negotiating a date for a hearing at the Ministry of Health to present our petition for assistance." 

"You tell me," Reese nods out his window.</docText>

To direct the detachment of forces is inspector greater Loblaw Robert, official of the veteran who lead very to guessed right equipment of Tethys Counterdrug.  He is optimist who he can identify the source.



"These drugs of designer have certain tracks as far as their origin," Loblaw these times in an interview.  "Whenever the prescription changes, it leaves tracks as far as it did whom it.  It is like a pedigr?."

Shale gas pioneer plans world's first offshore wells in Mediterranean Sea  

 

1984/05/04
 

&lt;&lt;Deleted Image: Anti-offshore drilling protester.  Exploration has proved a controversial issue in Kronos>> 

Continue reading the main story  

The son of the founder of gas firm GAStech is planning a venture to drill in the Mediterranean Sea, the Times has learned. believes there are large volumes of offshore gas that could be extracted. 

"Certainly offshore gas isn't a new concept, but there's no reason with the Kronosian history of offshore development that we can't develop these resources offshore," he told the Times. 

Shale gas is extracted using the controversial technique of hyper-acidic substrate removal which involves injecting acidic chemicals shale layers, to break them up and release the natural gas trapped within. 

GAStech has estimated that the Kronos total offshore shale gas resources could be between five and 10 times the size of the resources available onshore. But using the process on the large numbers of wells needed to extract offshore shale gas commercially has never been done.</docText>

Government Announces Tax Incentives For Foreign Investment 

 

1993/01/19
 

ABILA, Kronos - Today the Parliament voted 86 to 14 in favor of President Araullo's package of tax incentives designed to lure foreign investment to our fair country.

Ministry of the Interior projections show that development of just the Tiskele Bend fields could bring in as many as 5,000 high paying jobs and yield billions of dollars of infrastructure development over the next 20 years.</docText>

A LOOK BACK AT A LIFE CUT TRAGICAL SHORT: ELIAN KAREL
Petrus Gerhard
20 June 2011

ABILA, Kronos - Two years ago yesterday Elian Karel died at age 28 in an Abila jail cell, purportedly of cardiac arrest.  He had been arrested three months prior for spurious charges of tax evasion and left to linger in a jail cell without further legal action.  His attorney, Michale Kraft made several appearances in court demanding that the government outline their specific charges, and release Karel.  Kraft had reached an agreement with the government that charges would be reduced and the Karel be released pending a trial, but Karel died two days before he was to go free.
Questions linger, however, about the manner of Karel's death.  Requests for information were met with assurances that the police -whose custody Karel was in at the time of his death - would do everything possible to perform an exhaustive investigation.
This "thorough investigation" lasted all of two weeks, including the time it took the Abila City Coroner to lose the original autopsy files.  After Karel's body was cremated and sent to his family in Elodis, the Abila Chief of Police closed the case and has declined to answer questions about Karel's death stating that "we are satisfied the death was of natural causes and will no longer be entertaining inquiries."
As reported at the time of Karel's death, several people close to the investigation reported that Karel's body showed signs of blunt force trauma, abrasions and lacerations which were not consistent with the cause of death reported by the police.  These confidential sources have since moved from the area and have been unavailable for contact.
Police have denied anything unusual happened in Karel's death and city officials claim the accusations of murder and wrongful death are asserted by POK rabble-rousers attempting to incite instability and violence.
Yesterday on the morning of June 19th, a small group of POK supporters gathered in front of the Abila Police Station, holding photographs of Elian, and of another young martyr, Juliana Vann, the ten-year old girl who died in 1998 from cancer caused by benzene toxins in her drinking water.  
"Both of them died because of government lies and corruption," one man told me who asked that his name be withheld because of concerns of police retaliation.  "Juliana died because Kronos allowed GAStech to poison our water, and Elian died because he tried to bring Juliana justice.  When will it end?"
Another, larger crowd had gathered the day before in a nearby city park to bring public awareness about these same issues.  Amid the speeches and music, I heard the same message from the year before:  "Remember Juliana! Remember Elian!"</docText>

THE MEMBERS OF POK ARRESTED



2001/09/02


ELODIS, Kronos - heavies of the government obstructed the free speech - yet again - of the members of the protectors of the group of the activist of Kronos yesterday in a legal demonstration in the fields of the curve of Tiskele.  The five activists of POK had collected in front of the doors to the facility of the operations of the gas of GAStech that he perforated to cause to public conscience the contaminated river of Tiskele that has caused problems of health to the residents of Elodis.

The present people disclose that the demonstration had begun Pacific with the five members of POK that walked forwards and backwards through way, singing "remembers Julian" and "not more of poison"  

An eyewitness said that when the doors were opened to allow that the vehicles of the company of GAStech leave the facility the moved demonstrators to a side.  The witnesses apparently agree that at the same time the vehicles with the government of the seal of Kronos lead to the doors, gliding to incorporate the facility. 

"Era all the very civil one for above until then," Griffith Mabel, resident of Elodis that had left to support the POK said.   "The opened doors, the POK people moved and the cars expelled.  That one is when stranger obtained.  The cars stopped in means of the way for no reason."

Another eyewitness, farmer Charley Normand de Elodis adds, "yes, the POK individuals requested that the conductors moved pleasant, but the conductors of GAStech did not pay attention to them.  They had his windows down, so he was not as they could not hear them."

The renters of the vehicles of the government left and assembled of altercation.  The event sequence gets to be confused at this point.  Some witnesses indicate the instigadas discussions the conductors of GAStech with protestors, and others think that the officials of the government began to intimidate the demonstrators of the way.

"It is to people in the cars of the government were police," Mabel says.  "He used the uniforms and had currencies."

The Onlookers says that the three parties began to shout, and in a certain point the police of Kronos - of Abila- it arrested five activists it probably transported and them to a jail of Elodis.

In spite of the repeated orders an interview, has not granted the access those arrested.</docText>

THE COLLECTION POK DRAWS THOUSANDS OF VERDEDIGERS



2009/03/09


ABILA, Kronos - thousands of protesters which carry banners that remind Juliana! to read and chanting we want truth! collected for the Kronos government offices Saturday morning. Protesters required an accountancy of the government turnovers of then the tax incentives of president Araullo's who was signed in law in 1993.

Of ten years - old Juliana Vann died in 1998, to a sickness which is caused by polluted water of boring GAStech verrichtingen. They heart-rending the pictogram of a movement which has reached support of one end of Kronos to other, has become.

We were promised better lanes, new ways, better health care and a better standard of living, said one 20 years - old protestor which decreased to have its used name.  All to see I am larger lord houses for the ministers and the hospital which costs more to difficult situation than it can make.  We that! to approve

Protestor referred to the general hospital Abila that in 1997, seemingly with money of the raised turnover of the foreign gasverrichtingen here on Kronos are built.  The hospital has had difficulty which maintains its infrastructure, in spite of the vast restoration those sevearl years is carried out suffered for the elektro and plumber work systems to replace without winstbejag.

The contracts all were given to family and cronies of the ministers, 26 years accuse - old Jon L., which six hours reiste to attend collection yesterday.  What we have necessary transparency in our government is.  We must know what to already money happens that from these foreign comes commit.

LEADER Elian Karel of the protest aimed the demonstration systems at the park of the city Abila.  Karel took over control POK of Henk Bodrogi, of which bad health forced him of the position.  Karel spoke eloquently concerning the beginning of the campaign POK as a basis effort for clean water, to the dynamic movement demanding better government transparency and duty of responsibility have become.

We do not ask for unreasonably no matter what, Karel speak passionately to its enthusiastic auditors.  We want all must know how our taxes are used.  We know these companies report profits at the cost of Kronos produce, but we see none of promised improvements.  All we want duty of responsibility for they that because of cupidity, corruption and veronachtzaming of them died which they would have protect.

The question to the office of the President had not immediately returned.</docText>

Central paper of the center in the industry of the gas of Tethan 



1982/10/03


The world of the gas distant, difficult and is thrown far. In Tethys some years ago, I traveled laborious to the gas fields moved away of Tethys to watch a new debatable area of the energy production.

One of the sites that I visited was a local office of the company of the gas of Sanjorge, finessed with the shippers of the work and the reinforced covers and the chemical agents and the sources you need to work an operation of the gas. Like it memory, a previous truck driver was responsible.

It was an alive example of how a once small reconnaissance company of Thethys had begun to grow in a powerful international force in the industry of the energy.

But it had forgotten to me on the encounter until I again went to Tethys the other day for the first time from its years, to reacquaint with the man who created the business, Sten Sanjorge: a man (one of the richest individuals of Tethys) who has lived with the whole history of the gas that prospected and has prospered powerfully of him.

But like I was around the capital city of the people who entrevistaba with of the center, soon I made that this was not right a history of the new energy. Something very significant has happened to give return to the center in a global center of the masters of the industry of the gas. Of what it is developed in the capital city are important lessons for other places blessed (and it cursed) with the abundant natural resources.

The "center developed masters of the class of the world in directing in the very difficult environs"

When it was newspaperman young in the daily file in Glasgow at the beginning of years 70, the great attacks coast outside of the oil began in the North Sea. Then it looked like a pretty impossible dream, giving returned to an island of the coal in a place with the abundant sources of the oil and gas.

It was looked like us in the coast of the west of Scotland that the city far thrown of the center, Tethys was able to great small piece for its shippers, beginning to believe in a new industry of the fantasy.

Much to the grief of its mother, meanwhile, Sten Sanjorge had begun the prospection in early years 60.

By early years 70, a new company of the gas, GAStech, began his monster-like advances.

Under its direction canny, GAStech was developed in an important jet of the natural gas to the local region, and later it foments much to the distant spot. Now it has employees of the thousands and it works in numerous countries. 

The change in center has been substantial.  You notice in the constant uproar of helicopters to-Ing. and fro-Ing. towards it go to the moved away areas, and the planes aligned in the airport of the city to backwards go and execs forwards and of the city.

And as you lead around the center, almost each traffic circle is sponsored by a division of GAStech. 

Sanjorge has recently begun to pay more attention to the pastimes and filantrop?a, allowing that its Fluss hank of the Jr and the Co-founder of Sten of the son directs the company. But Sanjorge finishes requesting itself to produce a report for the government of Tethan that recommends the best ways to make sure that Tethys continues producing the energy per decades to come.

The matter of easy-to-obtaining has taken place, so to keep to come from the gas it will need much investment and new readier techniques, such as the hyperacid techniques of the retirement of the substratum developed by the company in 1974. 

It so thanks for ready people as Sten Sanjorge and the people who work with him, center has reached what wishes each place in where the raw materials are discovered to do. The city has taken the temporary favor from the energy in its threshold, and it has given to return in the specialized knowledge and the intellectual characteristic him that can make center a center of masters of the long gas after the gas itself works towards outside.</docText>

WHO ARE THE PROTESTERS  

 

2012/08/23
 

ABILA, Kronos - With the third anniversary of Elian Karel's death approaching - former member of the Protectors of Kronos - the question is: who are the protesters?  

 

The Protectors of Kronos or POK were founded in 1997 by residents of rural Elodis on the advice of the now defunct Wellness for All (WFA), an international water safety group. The POK was initiated to bring attention to the clean water issues surrounding Elodis to the Government of Kronos and the world. The POK asserts that GAStech International's Tiskele Bend natural gas drilling site is the source of both the contamination of drinking water as well as the destruction of the traditional farmland surrounding Elodis. However, with the fragmenting of WFA due to funding issues, the POK's demands were largely ignored and downplayed. The Government of Kronos officially refuted the claim citing the fragmentation of the WFA organization as evidence of an unreliable source not to be trusted. Regardless, Juliana became the POK's first martyr and has used Juliana's image on campaign literature ever since.  

 

The POK's second major martyr is Elian Karel, who died in 2009 while incarcerated of undetermined causes. The POK asserts he was arrested on trumped up charges while the Government of Kronos contends he was a radical and violent activist engaged in tax evasion. Karel had been involved with the POK since its inception given that his father, Jeroen Karel, was an original member.  

 

The POK has evolved from peaceful protests and demonstrations demanding government action to more violent activities including riots as they claim that the government has done little to nothing in addressing the contamination, poisonings, and deaths suffered by their people. As of 2011, the Government of Kronos has labeled the POK as a "public threat".</docText>

MISS INTENTIONS OF GOVERNMENT OF MARCH OF DETAILS



1993/02/03




ABILA, Kronos - in a President ?tincelant Luis Araullo of press conference late last year a historical whole of tax tax incentives designed announced to bring the foreign investment to Kronos under the appearance creating of employment, providing cheap energy and establishing the infrastructure.  After the voice 86-14 month last the Minister of Interior Department Tomas Sarto glorifi? the decision as the "limiting terminal" and "improving the people".

We will see.  The crafters of these revolutionary measurements neglected to include a plan detailed about the way in which these ventis would profit daily Kronosians.  When the first payment as of these alien company in the trunks of state, how these funds unload do will be dispersed?

One wonders:  Did the 14 which was opposed to measurement feel the same manner?  Did they wonder also exactly how this money would be directed in education, the improvements in roads, the utilities and the care of health?

Calls to the offices of the president were not turned over.</docText>

"This was in context of the dangerous scaling to the violence against Kronos and Kronosians and of a clear declaration by the POK that does not know to anything but violence.

"People to put under the POK terrorism are not possible for Kronos the state nor Kronos."

Kronos would notify Tethys that had signed a treaty 1998 of the against-terrorism of the decision, he added.

Those in favor of POK

The POK has denied the being responsible for the attack, and has accused the government of Kronos to carry out mark-for above silencing the preoccupations of the groups by people.

A member of POK said to times that the decision of the government was "ileg?tima".

He added: "The protests will continue, certainly."</docText>

2014/03/26
It is the first incident of his class in the history of the famous race of boat of the world, in which the yachts around the Mediterranean coast compete for the gold cup coveted.

The presidential boat, had by the family of present president Karel Kapelou II of Kronos, began to take in the water and disappeared slowly in the sea.

Cold



Most of the equipment entered the boats of the rescue, whereas other that decided to swim to the border described it like "cold".

Shortly after the presidential container perceivably was caused sorrow, a boat of small motor hurried forwards and backwards between the boat and to shake of the crowds of the coast the "protectors of Kronos" they indicate to offer by means of a flag its white emblem of the hand.  It is not known if the group were implied with the incident of the boat, although extensively recognize the group like getting to be more and more violent in its protests against the government.

The equipment rejected to blame the captain of the boat, 41 years Petra Hohimae, that are well to the current of waters of the line of the coast of Kronos.

One hopes that the race is cancelled although there has been no official word. The investigations to the presidential office have not been answered.

One hopes that the ball of the finery of the cup of Kapalou is cancelled tonight, although many international dignitaries and celebrities remain in the country.</docText>

Advantages of Kronos of foreign investment



1998/01/19


ABILA, Kronos - is today the fifth birthday of the visionary plan of the President Araullo' S to bring the foreign investment to Kronos, a daring act which derived the enormous advantages for our country right.  Abila of today is a metropolis activating new cars completely, of new construction, brilliant buildings of office, and modern suitabilities.  Went potholed of the streets, weak factories, front of store tired, and sad markets of the past.  Abila of today is a town of industry, a place of trade and investment, of a place of occasion and success.  Prosperity came in Kronos, and we are very better for him.



However, there remain those which think incorrectly that prosperity is bad for us.  These people claim that the foreign investment is bad for our country, that which it dilutes our culture and undermines our values.  They claim that the foreigners exploit us for their own profit and that our government makes consider little for the wellbeing of our people.  They are so militant in their false-directed belief which they manufactured claims that the alien companies poison our children with their technology.  They even went as much as to have brought the foreign "experts" who it complaint "have our best interests in the middle" helping to draw aside their agenda against progress and prosperity for our people.  Hypocrisy to bring the foreigners to say to us that the opening of our country the abroads is bad for us is laughable and is obviously a sign of psychosis in those which are opposed to our modernization.</docText>

GASTECH ADOPTS NEW LOGO

15 May 2009

CENTRUM, Tethys - With great fanfare GAStech International's President and CEO Sten Sanjorge, Jr. revealed the company's new logo, part of the company's rebranding process. 

During the press conference Sanjorge, Jr. spoke of the new logo - a tri-part blue flame - that is reminiscent of a leaf to "help position GAStech and its products as a clean fuel alternative." He also referenced that the tri-part flame represents the past, present, and future of the company in that by keeping "one eye on the past we know from where we came - our humble beginnings; one eye on the future we will know where we are going - our coming success; and both feet planted in the present we will be proactive in an ever-changing, competitive industry."

Finally, Sanjorge, Jr. asserted GAStech International's "blue flame is an enduring beacon of environmental responsibility, and a symbol of a clean energy business moving forward." 

This rebranding process and new logo seem to be in response to recent trouble the multi-national gas giant has been struggling with in Kronos including the February 19 protest at GAStech - Kronos' headquarters of 200 people who blocked entrance to the building, resulting in several arrests. The protest and others in and around Abila, the capital of Kronos, have been in response to alleged water contamination issues and a lack of Government and GAStech response.

Sten Sanjorge, Jr. declined to comment directly on questions regarding protests and environmental contamination. He deflected, "Today is a great day for GAStech. I won't let the day be derailed by unfounded, borderline libelous, allegations."</docText>

SPONTANEOUS PROTESTS ERUPT AROUND ABILA

20 June 2009

ABILA, Kronos - Protests erupted around the Kronos government buildings, downtown, and elsewhere around Abila eventually escalating into riots and violence. 

The activists are protesting the death yesterday of Elian Karel, a Protector of Kronos (POK) activist who died in jail after being arrested for tax evasion. However, the protests have turned violent with smashed windows and vandalized shops.

Countless shop windows smashed in and around Siopa, the downtown shopping area. A general sense of chaos broke out with chanting protesters, fires, and fleeing citizens. 

A unifying theme of the protesters was the chanted slogans including "Justice for Elian" in reference to previously mentioned activist Elian Karel and "Remember Juliana", a young girl from Elodis who died in 1998 allegedly from the effects of water contamination. Several buildings were defaced with the above mentioned slogans as well.

The Kronos government issued a statement, "This sort of violence will not be condoned. Destruction and violence is no way to achieve peace and change - these things are in opposition to each other. The Protectors of Kronos must resume peaceful means; all other approaches are unjustifiable."</docText>

WHO ARE THE PROTESTERS  

 

2012/08/22
 

ABILA, Kronos - With the third anniversary of Elian Karel's death approaching - former member of the Protectors of Kronos - the question is: who are the protesters? The POK was initiated to bring attention to the clean water issues surrounding Elodis to the Government of Kronos and the world. The POK asserts he was arrested on trumped up charges while the Government of Kronos contends he was a radical and violent activist engaged in tax evasion.  

 

The POK has evolved from peaceful protests and demonstrations demanding government action to more violent activities including riots as they claim that the government has done little to nothing in addressing the contamination, poisonings, and deaths suffered by their people.</docText>

ELODIS, KRONOS:  AID OF UNEXPECTED BRONDeel two



1998/04/26


This Article is the second advance of a three-part range the tackling growing problem of one fear of the community, government indictable offense, and the alarming influence of multinational companies on the country of Kronos.

I obtained Henk Bodrogi which in city in purchases make rise of the hardware at Ferro to repair a broken motor tractor.  Bodrogi have soya broad beans complete life have been treated, such as its father and their fathers. I asked him concerning its life on the agriculture company.

 We the country has for a long time worked - perhaps 200 years, perhaps told a beetje more, Henk Bodrogi me since he picked crap concerning a container of, which zoeken to the correct size.  In the course of the years we a couple has here and there added hectaren.  It occupies our.

Busy is a understatement, since I found then I the wiry farmer to tell me to porde more.

Leads I usually omhoog to the areas by sun, M. Henk Bodrogi tells me. My woman becomes omhoog the young young she-goats and heading to school, then they little something for us for lunch will turn to eat and beside me into diner to work.  When the children recover house of school they pass their jobs, and we are all at the house the most of times dark.

We do this the most days, he adds, except worship days.

Bodrogi identify the suitable bolt and chatter with the cashier concerning young young she-goats and school since he are completes purchase.

We all know each other it here, Bodrogi explain since we leave. The most of families have lived here for generations.  First new people who came to city were with that gasbedrijf that a couple year back. built

I ask Bodrogi if the matter has been well. 

We did to recently free good.  The profits were well and we add surface, or promote material.  Then started we have all this problem with the plants.

On which manner, I asked.

The plants do not produce if they have in the past.  It took one tijdje to calculate, then one of the town civil servants who are calculated to obtain a water specialist.  Then they tested it they said water. polluted was

Bodrodgi which are sighed, and with a besieged can in its eye he me for my interest thanked and he told had lead me behind to house.  The motor tractor had be confirmed before they the next day could work.  I thanked him and paid attention to him climb in its truck and head from city.

The water specialist appeared the international agency Wellness for all, an international agency with a task healthy bring water to communities to which by natural disasters it are agitated, drawing and - accidentally - oil and gasontwikkeling.

I obtained a representative of Wellness in for already next day.  Joclyn Reynolds are project coordinator for Wellness for all.  They spoke to me concerning a satellite question of its area office in South-East Asia where she was the efforts of the establishment aid after a earthquake. Mej. Reynolds came to me for a couple speak minutes between meetings concerning their work in Elodis.

We were contacted by a town civil servant concerning a problem they with their room water had.  In the last years agriculture had collapsed, and the by-effect of certain sicknesses and birth shortages had increased.  The drinking water Elodis comes from the river Tiskele, like already water for agriculture, so that upstream we zochten a source.  We found sources of the disposal of the production detritus upstream at the GAStech verrichting &lt;km>.  The tests showed high levels of benzene, toluene, xylene arsenic, lead and selenium, among other things toxin. 

Are possible substances these? of course prevention I asked her.

Not in these amounts, and not this sudden.  The pollution of the groundwater is usually the result of human activity.  Blow GAStech release polluting substances of a pond.  The toxin to form subsurface plucks which trickles in the river Tiskele of which the residents of Elodis their drinking water and irrigation for the plants. to draw

You spoke to GAStech concerning this?

Yes, she answered Oh.  We believed firstly we tractie reached.  We met representatives GAStech, including one including the higher staff employees, several keren strict Fluss.  He insured our personal GAStech would act responsibly to assist material and financial to cleaning turn effort.  After a time, nevertheless, it became clear that whereas M. Fluss were serious the Sanjorge were those decisions take.  It is clear that he [Sanjorge] no interest in the well-being of the residents of Elodis, or environment. has

Sten Sanjorge, Jr., which had its share in the company of its father in 1990, ge?rftf, a reputation for cutthroat company practices had developed.

Then we made no progress with GAStech, continuously Reynolds, the Community LEADERs decided for aid the government of Kronos to approach.   By our policy - and with authorization of the LEADERs Elodis - we published the test results in an officially public document.  The LEADERs Elodis approached then the government civil servants as citizens of a community Kronesian which is armed with the scientific analysis.  Our agency insured them we again its available anyway would help then those agreements became gebe?indigd. 

On this point Mej. Reynolds as from the tel. were called, so that I returned my redacteursvriend, Pondo Reese to tell the tale to finishing.

15 December 2013

ABILA, Kronos - Police spokesman Adrien Carmen informed the media today that members of the POK assaulted a police patrol in Abila early this morning.  The POK thugs crept up on two patrol officers who were sitting in their vehicle and ambushed the men, bashing the windows of their car and dragging them out of the vehicle into the street.  The officers were beaten, then tied and left in the trunk of their vehicle.  The criminals then proceeded to deface the car with spray-painted POK logos.

"Assaulting a police officer and destroying government property are serious crimes," Carmen said.  "I want to assure the public that these men will be caught and brought to justice soon."</docText>

2010/03/05


10th Kapalou cup was given to later less than one hour before it was due to the beginning after the capsized presidential ship and is descended.

It is the first incident of its kind in the history of the famous race of boat of the world, in which the yachts of around the Mediterranean coast compete with for the gold cup coveted.

The presidential boat, had by the family of the President running Karel Kapelou II of Kronos, started to take water and slowly disappeared in the sea.

Cold

Before an assistance of the hundreds of spectators met in the point of Abila, to be used it as team-member was forced to jump in the life raft and to observe their ship go down until it was almost submerged.

The major part of being used as team-member entered the boats of delivery, whereas others which decided to swim with the shore described it as "a cold".

Little time after the presidential ship was appreciably afflicted, a small boat of engine dispatched in the two directions between the boat and to undulate crowd of shore the "guards of Kronos" mark to comprise their white emblem of hand.  It is not known if the group were implied incident of boat, although the group is largely recognized like becoming increasingly violent in their protests against the government.

To be used as team-member refused to blame the captain of the boat, 41 years Petra Hohimae, which knows well about water in addition to littoral of Kronos.

POK REMEMBERS MARTYRED LEADER
Petrus Gerhard
20 June 2012

ABILA, Kronos - In a touching ceremony Wednesday leaders of the activist group Protectors of Kronos paid tribute to their fallen leader, Elian Karel, who was murdered on 19 June 2009 while being illegally detained in a Kronos jail.
"Today we gather to remember Elian Karel," Silvia Marek told the rapt assembly, many of whom held up white candles in Karel's honor.
"Elian was born on an Elodis farm not 40 minutes from here, to Jeroen and Antaura Karel.  He grew up with the specter of death all around him.   By the time Elian was 17 many of his family members and friends were battling constant illness, including his neighbor 10-year old Juliana Vann."
Marek paused a moment to allow the cries of "Remember Juliana!" to fade.
"Elian devoted his life to the people of Elodis as well as all citizens of Kronos, as did his father before him.  Elian knew his would be a difficult journey.  He had watched his father, Jeroen and the founder of the POK, Henk Bodrogi walk the very path he would tread.  Elian knew the course would not be easy, and would leave little time for a personal life.  Yet he chose to take those steps despite the challenges he knew he would face."
"Elian's journey ended three years ago today.  But his dream did not die with him.  And it is that vision of a healthy and prosperous future for all we are here today to honor."
Over the course of the afternoon several other speakers paid tribute to not only Elian, but all who have been victims of the environmental catastrophe brought about by greed and corruption of public officials. 
The gathering was marred only by the aggravating presence of Abila police in riot gear.  The police agitated many of the crowd, causing them to have to leave the assembly rather than be assailed with batons and pepper spray.</docText>

Four employees of GAStech suffered broken injuries including burns of smaller importance and bones.

He was also not damaged any local residents and although they evacuated to some residents of Elodis of his homes the investigation indicates that the evacuation was unnecessary. 



Whereas the official cause of the explosion still is under investigation, the problem could have come from a defect in the spring itself. The springs of GAStech are fastened with rings with the necklaces that have fixed per to us that they worked through them. One of per could have blown outside the necklace, sending the gas to us, that then made contact with enemy with a spark.</docText>

A GLANCE BEHIND IN A CUT TRAGICAL OF THE LIFE PUTS IN SHORT CIRCUIT: ELIAN KAREL



2011/06/21


ABILA, Kronos - for two years of Elian Karel died yesterday in age 28 in a cell of the jail of Abila, presumably of the failure cardiac.  They had arrested it three months previous for the false loads of left fiscal evasion and falling behind in a cell of the jail without the additional legal demand.  His lawyer, Michale Kraft made several aspects before the court demand that the contour of the government who its specific load, and Karel launching.  

The questions fall behind, nevertheless, on the way of the death of Karel.  The requests the information were satisfied with securings that the police - that guards Karel was inside at the time of its death - would do all possible one to make an exhaustive investigation.

This "careful investigation" lasted all the two weeks, including the time that took to Coroner of the city of Abila to lose the original archives of the autopsy.  After the body of Karel was incinerated and sent to its family in Elodis, the head of Abila of &lt;name> of the police closed the case and has declined to answer questions on the death of Karel that she indicated that "we are satisfied the death we were of natural causes and we will entertain not more investigations."

According to the disclosed thing at the time of the death of Karel, several people near the investigation disclosed that the body of Karel demonstrated samples of the dulled trauma of the force, the abrasions and the laceraciones which was not constant with the cause of the death disclosed by the police.  These confidential sources have moved from the area and have been since then prohibitive for the contact.

The police has denied to any happened unusual thing in the death of Karel and the civil employees of the city demand the accusations of the murder and the illicit death is affirmed by POK shakes-rousers to try to urge instability and violence.

Yesterday in the morning of the 19 of June, a small group of POK those in favor collected in front of the police station of police of Abila, maintaining the photographies of Elian, and young other martyr, Julian Vann, the one of ten years - the old girl who died in 1998 of cancer caused by toxins of the benzene in her potable water.  

"Both they died due to lies of the government and the corruption," a man said to me that it asked that its well-known is retained due to preoccupations of the revenge of the police.  "Julian it died because Kronos allowed that GAStech poisoned our water, and dead Elian because he tried to bring the justice of Julian.  When it finishes"

2020 - Media outlets are reporting that a government spokesman who asked not to be named because he was not authorized to speak to the press stated that the GAStech employees had been kidnapped and the Kronos government was working hard to identify the lawbreakers.  One wonders if they are also working hard to recover the GAStech people as well, or if this is an opportunity to profit from the misfortunate of others. 20 Jan 2014</docText>

2021 UPDATE - A Kronos Government official who asked not to be identified but was present at the government reception has gone on the record stating, "Investigators are working around the clock to ensure that the kidnapped GAStech employees are found and that the perpetrators are brought to justice."
This is the first confirmation that today's events surrounding GAStech - Kronos are in fact a kidnapping. With fourteen individuals still unaccounted for, at this point, the assumption is that all are the victims of a kidnapping.
No group has come forward yet to claim responsibility nor have any demands been made.</docText>

POK Protest at GAStech Headquarters Ends in Arrests
Marcella Trapani
18 February 2009

ABILA, Kronos - Dozens of protesters attending a Protectors of Kronos (POK) rally in front of the GAStech regional headquarters in Abila were arrested for trespassing this morning.  The POK rally was intended to draw attention to their claims of environmental damage being caused by the development of gas and oil fields around Kronos by foreign corporations like GAStech.  About two hundred people gathered in front of the GAStech building chanting slogans and waving signs that held the visages of people who have allegedly died due to environmental contamination.  Ten of the protestors chained themselves to the doors of the building in an attempt to prevent GAStech employees from going to work.

Police spokesman Adrien Carman said, "We allowed the group some latitude with their rally, but when GAStech complained that the protestors were blocking entrance to their building, we had to take action.  The last thing we wanted to happen was for a GAStech employee to get hurt by the crowd just because he was trying to go to work."

The POK, once a small political activist group of citizens from the Elodis area, has been revitalization under the charismatic leadership of Elian Karel.  Government spokesman Rufus Drymiau said of today's POK rally, "We have been concerned by a pattern of increasingly aggressive tactics by the Protectors of Kronos for some time now. In light of today's incident, President Kapelou has ordered the police to provide additional protection for the public at future POK rallys."</docText>

GASTech Employees Kidnapped in Kronos

21 January 2014  1405
Fourteen employees feared kidnapped in Kronos by a radical environmental terrorist group during a corporate gathering. 
Fourteen employees, including possibly five executive officers, are feared kidnapped yesterday by the "Protectors of Kronos".  Reported missing includes: GAStech President and CEO Sten Sanjorge Jr,CFO Ingrid Barranco, CIO Ada Campo-Corrente, COO Orhan Strum, and Environmental Officer Willem Vasco-Pais.
Local news organizations have received a ransom note from the POK claiming responsibility and demanding $20 Million from the company.  It is possible additional demands are forthcoming.
Sanjorge and the others disappeared following a board meeting at GASTech headquarters.  A fire alarm went off, and the execs were discovered missing shortly after that.  The complete list of all the unaccounted-for employees has not been released. 
John Rathburn, an American expert on executive kidnappings who is living in Tethys, says that Kronos has not been known as an archetypal country for kidnapping. "However, increased activity by POK, APA [Asterian People's Army], and others in the region have significantly increased the risk."
The Times's correspondent in Abila says GASTech offices are closed, and phone calls are being answered but referred to local authorities.  
GASTech's corporate headquarters in Tethys have refused to comment. However, other news sources have reported Tethys federal law enforcement officials and staff from the Tethan Ministry of Foreign Affairs have arrived in Kronos to assist police in the investigation.</docText>

A LOOK BACK AT A LIFE CUT TRAGICAL SHORT: ELIAN KAREL
Petrus Gerhard
20 June 2011

ABILA, Kronos ? Two years ago yesterday Elian Karel died at age 28 in an Abila jail cell, purportedly of cardiac arrest.  He had been arrested three months prior for spurious charges of tax evasion and left to linger in a jail cell without further legal action.  His attorney, Michale Kraft made several appearances in court demanding that the government outline their specific charges, and release Karel.  Kraft had reached an agreement with the government that charges would be reduced and the Karel be released pending a trial, but Karel died two days before he was to go free.
Questions linger, however, about the manner of Karel?s death.  Requests for information were met with assurances that the police ?whose custody Karel was in at the time of his death ? would do everything possible to perform an exhaustive investigation.
This ?thorough investigation? lasted all of two weeks, including the time it took the Abila City Coroner to lose the original autopsy files.  After Karel?s body was cremated and sent to his family in Elodis, the Abila Chief of Police closed the case and has declined to answer questions about Karel?s death stating that ?we are satisfied the death was of natural causes and will no longer be entertaining inquiries.?
As reported at the time of Karel?s death, several people close to the investigation reported that Karel?s body showed signs of blunt force trauma, abrasions and lacerations which were not consistent with the cause of death reported by the police.  These confidential sources have since moved from the area and have been unavailable for contact.
Police have denied anything unusual happened in Karel?s death and city officials claim the accusations of murder and wrongful death are asserted by POK rabble-rousers attempting to incite instability and violence.
Yesterday on the morning of June 19th, a small group of POK supporters gathered in front of the Abila Police Station, holding photographs of Elian, and of another young martyr, Juliana Vann, the ten-year old girl who died in 1998 from cancer caused by benzene toxins in her drinking water.  
?Both of them died because of government lies and corruption,? one man told me who asked that his name be withheld because of concerns of police retaliation.  ?Juliana died because Kronos allowed GAStech to poison our water, and Elian died because he tried to bring Juliana justice.  When will it end??
Another, larger crowd had gathered the day before in a nearby city park to bring public awareness about these same issues.  Amid the speeches and music, I heard the same message from the year before:  ?Remember Juliana! Remember Elian!?</docText>

ELODIS, KRONOS:  A TOWN IN NEED, Part One 

Petrus Gerhard 

1998/03/20
 

NOTE: This article is the first in a series, reprinted with permission from the Homeland Illumination. 

 

This article is the first installment of a three-part series addressing the growing problem of one community's anguish, government malfeasance, and the alarming influence of multinational corporations on the country of Kronos. 

ELODIS, Kronos - Nestled in the bend of the Tiskele River, the sun rises over the farming town of Elodis,  chasing away the shadows cloaking nearby Mt.  Today, as they have every day for over 250 years, residents will rise to tend the rich floodplain land that provides nourishment for the People of Kronos. 

Two weeks prior I received an email from an old friend, Pondo Reese, now the editor of the Elodis Weekly Journal, an agriculture paper serving the community around Tiskele Bend.  "The gas company had been built a few years back in '94, and our problems didn't start right away. 

The change turned out to be GAStech International, an international corporation run by Sten Sanjorge Jr, a business tycoon out of Tethys. 

Established in 1961, the GAStech corporation began as a family-owned business providing local trucking services in Tethys.  The two founders - Sten Sanjorge Sr and Hank Fluss - found wildcat drilling to be more lucrative, and thus began a series of environmental disasters and financial scandals that eventually ran Sanjorge Sr into an early grave and drove Fluss into a marginal role in his own company.  With the death of Sanjorge Sr, the son took the helm of GAStech firmly in his grasp and broadened its influence further afield, eventually landing at the doorstep of the small peaceful township of Elodis. 

With a population of 6500, most residents of Elodis live in one- and two-story houses on small farms.  A smaller number of families live in the township along a main street with two markets, two hardware stores, one gas station and a caf??????here you can buy lunch, pick up your mail and purchase a litre of milk to bring home.  Families have lived in Elodis for generations. 

"We've made a good living for a long time," Reese tells me. 

I asked Reese to help me meet the people whose lives have been impacted by GAStech's operations.   

I caught up with Henk Bodrogi in town making purchases at the Osvaldo hardware store to repair a broken tractor.  Bodrogi has farmed soybeans his entire life, as did his father and their fathers.</docText>

DRILLING TECHNIQUE BANNED IN TETHYS 

 

1995/03/30
 

CENTRUM, Tethys - GAStech International's Hyper Acidic Substrate Removal (HASR) has officially been banned by the Tethys government due to the high probability of water contamination.  

 

GAStech developed the innovative drilling technique in 1974 proved quite successful for the extraction of gas, but the technique's environmental impact is deemed unacceptable by the Tethys government due to the high probability of water table contamination from waste products produced during the HASR process.</docText>

LACK OF DETAILS MARS GOVERNMENT INTENTIONS 

 

1993/02/02
 

 

ABILA, Kronos - In a glitzy press conference late last year President Luis Araullo announced a historic set of tax incentives intended to bring foreign investment to Kronos under the guise creating jobs, providing cheap energy and building infrastructure.  Following the 86-14 vote last month the Minister of the Interior Tomas Sarto lauded the decision as "landmark" and "bettering the people".  The crafters of these revolutionary measures neglected to include a detailed plan about how this windfall would benefit everyday Kronosians.  When the first payment from these foreign company lands in the state coffers, how will these funds be dispersed?</docText>

GOVERNMENT CITES 'MINOR' CONTAMINATION NEAR ELODIS 

 

1997/10/16
 

ABILA, Kronos - After continued complaints and appeals from the people of Elodis government officials acknowledge minor contamination in and around the rural township in a report on their investigation into the townspeople's health issues. However, the government report stops short of blaming GAStech International and its Tiskele Bend site 20 km upstream as the people of Elodis assert.  

 

The government report cites no root cause or causes can be determined at this time with more research and investigations needed. 

 

Though the report admits some contamination it goes on the qualify the level stating, "The minor level of contamination is well within international health standards agreed upon by the Government of Kronos and GAStech International as negotiated in the Tiskele Bend site contract."</docText>

GAStech 

22 February 2013

It is the biggest company in Kronos, the third largest gas company on the planet, and it is fifty-three years old. In the past it has had a reputation as corrupt and environmentally harmful, but nowadays GAStech, the former Tethys-only business, is trying to earn the trust of international investors. This forms part of its ambitions to expand its profitable business supplying gas outside of the Mediterranean region.
It is an uphill task, and there is no certainty that Gastech has the ability to convince potential investors it has mended its ways, and is no longer rooted in the eco-hostile past.
GAStech's pipeline operations are based in eastern Kronos, and there is close relationship with the Kronosian government. This is the heart of Kronos's pipeline business, where gas from the eastern gas fields is piped west towards the rest of Kronos, Tethys and Europe.
GAStech does more than just pump gas. It has created towns and cities to service its operations, which it manages and runs almost single-handed.
The head of GAStech, Sten Sanjorge, Jr, whose photo stares out from calendars and picture frames everywhere in the country, acknowledges the "state within a state" accusations, but argues that the company simply needs to look after its workers and the communities around them.
Of course, people need good reasons to come and work in the hostile remote Kronosian regions. They are provided with medical care, entertainment, and food. The GAStech empire owns 2 thousand cows and 3 thousand pigs in its company farms, runs gyms, and offers subsidised holidays in Black Sea resorts for key employees. For executives, it runs a state of the art, marble-lined medical and therapy centre.
In addition to all of these perks, there is also the GAStech TV station, which doesn't even pretend to be unbiased. It's there to serve the company's will.
It hardly seems the picture of a modern global company, as most of those have unceremoniously dumped their "non-core activities". There is an argument, however, that the energy business is different from other industries, requiring energy corporations to operate in distinct ways.
Working in far-off places with no previous infrastructure means oil and gas sites will always be, to some extent, company towns. GAStech certainly strives to ensure its employees can move in and out of these locations by operating a private fleet of four planes to ferry its staff the huge distances between sites.</docText>

Profile:  Elian Karel 



2009/06/23


&lt;&lt;deleted the image of Elian Karel speaking with a gathering in Abila>>

The voice of the protest for some, the demagog of popularist for others, guards of the Chief Elian Karel de Kronos became a gathering martyrdom and point for some; a figure of scorn and rabblerousing for others, and a political concern with the government of Kronosian, in one year filled by event, accentuated by its suspicious death Friday. 

The chief of an environmental group forbearant of activist, Karel had begun a mark of the policy all his clean, which propelled the POK in the projector of this nation of island.

Filled of fuel by a dissatisfaction growing with regard to the awkward government with Kronosian, it started to lead the POK in an organization action-based, instead of one awaiting their government to make the aright things.

By ressuscitant embers of Juliana Vann to make countryside, the 10 year old girl who died of the diseases allotted to the industrial jets of reject of the government-favoured company of GASTech in 1998, Karel was stopped and thrown in prison according to a human stopping of road POK-launched in front of registered offices of GAStech in May. Karel died Wednesday while serving time in prison. The government of Kronos refuses the comment on the circumstances of its death.

Rather charismatic, Karel could inspire a crowd and draw attention to the social and political agenda of POK.  It could also tickle the funny bone of its assistances.  Once, after Jr. of Sten Sanjorge of PRESIDENT de GAStech compared the POK with a group of terrorist in an interview of pressure, Karel scoffed, "Sanjorge is a brilliant chief of GAStech. Do you know why it takes a scale with him with the supermarket?  It heard that the prices of foodstuffs in Abila are really high."

However, its capacity to engage in finally the government makes violence of Kronos had never been clear.  It is also not very clear which will take its coat in the POK now that it went.</docText>

GAStech 



2013/02/24


It is the biggest company of Kronos, the third bigger company of the gas in the planet, and is years of fifty-three. In the past it has had a corrupt reputation like and environmentally harmful, but nowadays GAStech, the previous business of Tethys-only, is trying to gain the confidence of international investors. This form the part of its ambitions to extend its gas that provides with the beneficial business outside the Mediterranean region.

It is an ascending task, and there is no certainty that Gastech has the capacity to convince potential investors that it has repaired his ways, and it is rooted not more in the past echo-hostile.

The operations of the pipe of GAStech are based on Kronos of the east, and is near relation with the government of Kronosian. This one is the heart of the business of the pipe of Kronos, where the gas of the gas fields of the east settles tubes to the west towards the rest of Kronos, Tethys and Europe.

GAStech does more than as soon as the gas of the pump. It has created cities and cities to maintain his operations, that it handles and it works almost single-giving.

The head of GAStech, Sten Sanjorge, Jr, that photo watches fixedly towards outside calendars and of marks throughout in the country, recognizes "state inside the accusations of a state", but she discusses that the necessities of the company simply to take care of his workers and of the communities around them.

By all means, to populate the good reasons with the necessity to come and to work in the hostile remote regions of Kronosian. They provide medical aid, the hospitality, and the food. The empire of GAStech has 2 thousand cows and 3 thousand pigs in its farms of the company, it works gyms, and it offers subsidized holidays in the resources of the Black Sea for the dominant employees. For the executives, it works a state extreme extra, a medical center and of the marble-aligned therapy.

In addition to all these allowances, there is also the station of GAStech TV, that does not even pretend to be impartial. It is there serving the will as the company.

It looks like as soon as the picture of a modern global company, as most of those have unloaded little ceremonious their "activities of the not-heart". There is a discussion, nevertheless, that the business of the energy is different from other industries, requiring the corporations of the energy to work of different ways.

Working in remote places without previous means of the infrastructure to lubricate and the sites of the gas they will be always, until certain point, cities of the company. GAStech makes certainly an effort to assure its employees can move inside and outside these locations working a deprived fleet of four planes to ferry across to its personnel the enormous distances between the sites.</docText>

1947 UPDATE - From the Abila Police news conference: "There are approximately fourteen individuals unaccounted for among the GAStech staff. It has not yet been determined if all of these individuals are in fact missing."
Though it was confirmed that over a dozen individuals were unaccounted for, the Abila Police said that that does not mean they are necessarily missing. Nor does it mean that they have been abducted. At this point the case is under investigation and more information will be released as facts are learned.
The Abila Police stressed that anyone seeing any unusual activity should immediately report it.</docText>

POSSIBLE CONTAMINATION IN ELODIS  

 

1997/04/23
 

ELODIS, Kronos - About 25 km West of Abila is the small rural township of Elodis, situated on the Tiskele River. Roughly 20 km upstream is the Tiskele Bend site operated by GAStech International on government-owned land. Townspeople claim the site is contaminating the land and water making their people sick. 

 

In a statement the government of Kronos has denied that the Tiskele Bend site is the source of any contamination insisting that both "natural gas and the drilling process are clean." The statement continued, "If our people are sick we will help them get well. That is the duty of government: to protect its people."</docText>

TAX MEASURE DEFEATED, POK EFFORTS STALLED
Maha Salo
22 March 2001

Abila, Kronos - A measure to increase taxes on foreign oil and gas development proposed by Minister of Health Cesare Nespola was defeated by a wide margin last week in the General Assembly.
This defeat is a harsh blow to the Protectors of Kronos, an Elodis group that was counting on this funding to provide healthcare and environment cleanup of their drinking and irrigation water.
"We have a meeting planned with the Minister," Protectors of Kronos leader Henk Bodrogi told the Homeland Illumination.  "Don't count us out yet.  We plan to improve the measure and Minister Nespola will reintroduce it later this year."
Bodrogi is the leader of the Protectors of Kronos, a grassroots environmental group with a mission to reverse the pollution caused by gas drilling in his hometown.</docText>

Abila police break up sit-in turned violent at the presidential manor  

 

2012/06/20
 

Traffic snarled around the city as Abilians struggle to get to work amid vandalism and looting 

Early on Tuesday police stormed the front of the presidential mansion and the capital building, breaking up a sit in by the Protectors of Kronos. 

The conservative Kronos government used an emergency law to threaten the protestors with arrest unless they dispersed and returned to work.  The row is over environmental issues the POK holds the government and the gas giant GAStech international responsible.  

Signs among the protester called for government change and social equality.  Images of Juliana Vann, the 10 year old girl who dies from illnesses attributed to the industrial giant GAStech international served as rallying points.   

Tuesday was the third anniversary of the mysterious death of Elian Karel, a popular leader of the POK who died in prison.  

Later in the day, what had been a largely peaceful demonstration turned violent when the crowd started vandalizing government buildings and the presidential homestead.  

Police reinforcements were sent to the area and blocked roads, and skirmishes between the police and protestors broke out.  

Police used tear gas to break up the unruly crowd.  Government spokesmen complemented the security forces for their handling of the "gangs of criminals" disrupting the peace.</docText>

Annual POK Rally Ends in Riot, Again
Marcella Trapani
20 June 2013

ABILA, Kronos - POK members held their annual demonstration in Abila yesterday.  A larger than usual crowd gathered in front of the Capitol building, waving signs holding pictures of Elian Karel and Juliana Vann, who were painted as POK "martyrs".  The crowds chanted about government corruption and called for President Dorel Kapelou to step down.  Several protestors carried signs calling for an end to the "exploitive Tethys corporate capitalism" and alleging, "GAStech poisoned our kids".  

Police and government security forces set up between the protestors and the Capitol building in a show of force, hoping to prevent the kind of chaos that occurred during last year's riot.  However, after several hours of chanting and speeches, tempers in the crowd flared and protestors rushed the police line.  The police forces were forced to use tear gas, pepper spray, water cannons, and rubber bullets to subdue the crowd and protect property.  In spite of their heroic efforts, the protestors managed to break some windows, damage several police vehicles, and injure three officers.</docText>

Activists Disrupt Traffic Near Tiskele Bend Fields 

 

2001/08/31
 

 

ABILA, Kronos - Five young people were arrested yesterday for protesting near the entrance to the Tiskele Bend fields as they called for government action to address their environmental concerns about GAStech's operations at the site.  The protestors, members of the activist group "Protectors of Kronos", held signs reading: "Drilling Poisoned Our Water" and "Remember Juliana", referring to 10 year old Juliana Vann, who has become an icon for the Protectors of Kronos since her death in 1998.  The protestors were arrested after one young man threw his sign at a government vehicle, cracking its window and startling the occupants.  Police spokesman Adrien Carman said of the arrests, "We decided to shut the protest down before the POK members escalated to further violence.  "The people of Kronos have overwhelmingly been for the development of our natural resources and all have benefited from the resultant economic growth.</docText>

The protests of Kronos burst in violence 



2013/11/13


The journalist Shawn Pastorini says that the "lack of respect" fills of fuel the protests

&lt;&lt; to continue to read the principal history >>	

The demonstrators in Abilia, Kronos put fire at the buildings of government, in another round of faintness in this torn city

Dozen people was wounded in the corruption of government perceived by surplus of protests and the incapacity perceived of the politicians to improve the situation.

To maintain the order the rubber balls and teargas used to alleviate it Malayan in capital Abila. Black smoke could be to come seen compound from the presidency in Abila.

&lt;&lt; to continue to read the principal history >>	

Guards of spokesman of Kronos indicated "in Kronos environmental legacies of the negligence and the lack of concern for the means of people this some equal hope for the change more. For this reason, anger had fermented during years, but now it boiled the surplus"

To maintain the order water used to disperse the protesters who threw stones with the building. There were also reports/ratios to give the attack to tested office.

"To populate the protest because they suffer, because they do not have the medical aid. We require the government resign," Terek Kamal, a driver of truck, said times.

Faintness started in Abila earlier in week, by protests above the reference of several employees of Kronosian of international giant GAStech energy.  GAStech has its roots in Tethys, although many directors live in Kronos.

This seems to be a case to ferment the destruction boiling more.

The administration is strongly of support of GAStech and its income of taxes to the trunks of government - however seems to be unaware of all the questions the pressure but its own packages with-top-means of wages.

The environmental situation is desperate. The hundreds of rural citizens suffer from the principal diseases apparently caused by exposure to the jets of reject of GAStech, although it was not a justified civil servant or does not recognize by the company or government. 

It is what ?tincel? the initial protests in Abila - but the empathy with their cause brought demonstrators outside in the cities through Kronos.  At the beginning peaceful, those protest are now more and more violent one, and organizes it and the citizens are caught in the formerly mortal interference current.  

President Dorel Kapelou II of Kronos is quoted saying bus it would convene a pressing meeting of higher control to address the "threat of terrorist for peace" in the country.</docText>

GASTECH EMPLOYEE INTERROGATED, RELEASED 

 

2014/01/20
 

ABILA, Kronos - For roughly 6 hours GAStech - Kronos employee Edvard Vann was interrogated by Kronos Police and Government officials before being released at 17:00 this evening. The apparent confusion stems from the similarity between his name and that of a Protector of Kronos member. 

 

Vann, a security guard for GAStech, was furious, stating, "I have nothing to do whatsoever with any members of the terrorist group POK. I was born here in Abila and I support my government and my president. Being accused and being interrogated for 6 hours as a terrorist POK member is one of the worst days of my life. With some 14 GAStech employees still unaccounted for, one cannot blame the police or the government for not leaving any stone unturned.</docText>

Abila Hospitals Seeing Influx of Designer Drug Users 

 

2013/02/08
The Emergency Department at Abila General Hospital in Kronos has been swamped in the last month by people suffering medical complications from designer drugs such as "cotton candy" and synthetic marijuana, a hospital official said. Citywide, several deaths have been attributed to "Cotton Candy" according to the Kronos National Poison Center. 

Designer drugs are chemical compounds synthesized to resemble the active ingredient in often illegal drugs. Cotton candy mimics the drug khat, a stimulant. Manufacturers frequently change the designer drug's chemical composition and its name to stay one step ahead of authorities, Biance said. 

The term cotton candy, for example, is a nickname of the drug and has nothing to do with the carnival treat.  

The Kronos government has placed three of the chemicals commonly used in the creation of cotton candy on its controlled substance list, criminalizing their use and possession. Still, the government cannot outright ban cotton candy because manufacturers can alter the recipe and skirt the law, Bianca said. She said a gram of cotton candy costs about K18 while a gram of cocaine costs K166. The crash's ill-effects often prompt people to binge on cotton candy to the point where they consume the drug for days. The Asterian People's Army has traditionally been involved with drug trafficking throughout the region, and enforcement agencies are closely examining possible cooperation between drug trafficking organizations and political insurgent groups.</docText>

GOVERNMENT LABELS POK 'PUBLIC THREAT'  

 

2011/07/28
 

ABILA, Kronos - The Kronos Government has labeled the Protectors of Kronos (POK) as a threat to the public. In a statement by government spokesman Rufus Drymiau the POK are described as "justifiably a public threat due to violent demonstrations, opportunistic vandalism, and clashes with the police." 

 

A shop owner in the Siopa district, who declined to be named, responded to the government labeling the POK a public threat: "I agree they are a public threat. Every time they come around they bring their signs and then they smash windows. 

 

Officer Emilio Haber, who patrols the Siopa district, said of the POK, "They smash the windows. They make themselves look stupid and then we arrest them and put them in jail where they belong."</docText>
